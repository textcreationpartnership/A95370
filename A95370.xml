         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </gap>eſs of the time which was ſpent in the compoſing, but for my own juſt and neceſſary vindication, that the world might ſee and be ſatisfied what it was that had opened the mouth of Calumny and Detraction ſo wide; and Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received information that there was a deſign to make my Sermon publick, which Iacknowledge I ought not to have done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s good leave, by whoſe commiſſion and authority it was preached, I was commanded to deliver up my Notes to be peruſed by Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> before they went to the Preſs; but it ſo happening that they were then actually in it, before that order came, and the firſt ſheet having been printed off, all the poſſibility of Obedience that was left me was, to recall my Papers from the Preſs and lay them at Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s feet, as they were, torn in pieces by the Printer, and in a condition very much aſhamed to make their appearance before You.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> was ſenſible of the confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Papers, as well as my ſelf were in, and would not ſuffer them to bluſh in your
<pb facs="tcp:172970:4"/> preſence, but was pleas'd to diſmiſs me in a moſt obliging manner, for which unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted goodneſs, when I came ſo apprehenſive, as I was, of a leſs favourable uſage, I am bound to pay you my everlaſting thanks, and to command me further, not without expreſſing ſome trouble at the incivility and indiſcretion of Sir <hi>P. W.</hi> which was indeed an affront to Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> and the whole Clergy of the three Kingdoms in my perſon, to let you ſee the Papers when they were printed.</p>
                  <p>I came away, as I had reaſon, from <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> where I had the honour to pay my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> then going to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, not onely well ſatisfied, but very much tranſported with ſo obliging an anſwer; and having now a Licence from your ſelf, as well as from the Eighth of the Eccleſiaſtical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons made and ſet forth by a Convocation of the two Provinces in 1640. whereby we are obliged twice every year to preach upon the Subject of <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> (and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may be preached, may be printed alſo if occaſion ſo require) I had now a double en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to go on with the Impreſſion, and accordingly I did go on.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:172970:5"/>
                  <p>If Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> ſhall demand of me, as it is very natural for you to doe, what was the reaſon of its publication being ſo long delayed, all the anſwer I can make is that it was, (ſo far was I at firſt from deſigning it for the Preſs, had I not been provoked to it by the clamours of the worſt of men, as well as encourag'd to ſtand up in my own defence by ſuch as were friends to the Government, and by conſequence to me) I ſay, as it was, I found it to be a very imperfect and unfiniſh'd piece, and ſuch as had reaſon to apprehend the cenſures of its friends as well as enemies; therefore I preſumed to take the liberty, not to alter any thing which I had ſpoken, but onely to add ſo much to it, as might make a juſt diſquiſition upon the Subject, and yet if I had taken a liberty of making alterations, ſo it had been onely in the expreſſion, not the ſenſe, it would have been ſuch a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as would have been vouched by the beſt examples that antiquity affords: <hi>Pliny,</hi> as himſelf confeſſes in his Epiſtles, did ſo by his Panegyrick to the Emperour <hi>Trajan;</hi> and before him that great Maſter as well of thought as expreſſion did the ſame by his Oration in defence of <hi>Milo,</hi> and not to
<pb facs="tcp:172970:5"/> ſay any thing of the <hi>Verrine</hi> Orations, and the invectives againſt <hi>Catiline,</hi> it is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to believe that the <hi>Philippicks,</hi> inſtead of being burnt as <hi>Anthony</hi> would have had them, have been tranſmitted to Poſterity with an improvement of incens'd eloquence and <hi>Ciceronian</hi> rage.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing indeed, which I know not whether I ought to mention or no, which did receive ſome little alteration, if the omiſſion of a Line or two, for it was no more, may be called by that name; and that is, that upon occaſion of diſcourſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the perſecution ſtill raging in the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of the <hi>French</hi> King, I did ſpeak of his Majeſty, out of the zeal I had for the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and being under no tie of obedience to a foreign Prince, but onely of reſpect to his Character if he do worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſtain it, with ſo much ſharpneſs and Satyr, comparing his Perſecution to that of <hi>Nero, Maximine</hi> or <hi>Diocleſian</hi> which was the very thing and the onely thing that was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that there were perſons, as I ſuppoſe, appointed by the Congregation <hi>de propagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da ſide,</hi> the Committee that manage the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Faction, to buz in my ears, as
<pb facs="tcp:172970:6"/> an argument to diſcourage me from publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing what I had ſpoken, that my Sermon would have the honour of being tranſlated into <hi>French,</hi> for the uſe of <hi>Monſieur Barillon;</hi> that a complaint would be made by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour in a memorial on ſet purpoſe, that I had broken the Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Nations, and that a <hi>Fellow</hi> of a College, that had not ſo much as a <hi>Pupil</hi> to take his part, had preſumed barely with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his <hi>Sizar,</hi> a worthy Squire to ſo redoubted a Knight, to levy actual War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt potent and formidable Prince that theſe latter Ages of the World have ſeen; though I was not ſenſible that I had ſaid any more, than they themſelves who made uſe of this advantage againſt me, are every day ſpeaking among one another with a bitterneſs of Language peculiar to the men that uſe it; though for this perhaps the <hi>French</hi> King is to thank them that they take no more liberty with him than they do with their own rightfull Sovereign and natural liege Lord, the one for ſubverting the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Religion, and the other for maintaining it, which ſhews them to be a People ſo very hard to be pleaſed that I am reſolved never

                  <p>So that I think upon the whole matter <hi>Sorbiere</hi>'s caſe and mine are very different from one another, though that were the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that was uſed to fright me, for I have
<pb facs="tcp:172970:7"/> not ſpoken contemptibly of the <hi>French</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I have always accounted of as a gallant People, valiant in War and always excelling in all the arts of Peace, much leſs have I dared to vilifie the awfull Majeſty of ſo great a King, whoſe Sovereign Power I do as much acknowledge to be an image of the divine, inviolable, ſacred, and never to be mentioned without reverence and honour, as I do that of our <hi>Royal Maſter</hi> himſelf, the beſt of Princes, the Father of his Country, the delight of Mankind, the wonder of this Age, and the inimitable Example of all that are to come, but yet I think it to be ſuch an image as it would be inexcuſable Idolatry in me who am an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subject to fall down and worſhip.</p>
                  <p>And as my caſe is very different from that of <hi>Sorbiere</hi> ſo are my circumſtances too; for he they tell me for the indignities he put upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, the braveſt people that the Sun beholds, was deſervedly turned out of all, but I am humbly bold to tell Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> and the reſt of my Superiours that I have nothing out of which to be turned and that I ſhould think my ſelf comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy in reſpect of what I am now, if I
<pb facs="tcp:172970:7"/> could be placed in his circumſtances without the crime that occaſion'd them, and as I am a ſtranger to his circumſtances and his crime ſo, I thank God, I am as far removed from his Principles too, for he and his two friends <hi>Merſennus</hi> and <hi>Gaſſendi</hi> were of the Religion of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> if they had any at all, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their joint admiration of the Book <hi>De Cive,</hi> the <hi>Latin Leviathan</hi> that ſports him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in foreign waters as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> one does upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Coaſt, but I own no princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that deſtroy the very nature and being of obligation, and are by conſequence ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Mankind.</p>
                  <p>But it is eaſie to diſcern that all I have yet ſaid is by no means a ſatisfactory anſwer to Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s, queſtion, why the edition of this Sermon hath been ſo long delayed, for the Additions to it are not ſo conſiderable that the twentieth part of all this time need to have been taken up about them; and though indeed when I am brought to this pinch I cannot give a good account of ſuch a ſlow and dilatory proceeding, yet a true one I will be ſure to give, and it is this, that when I had written and printed off ten ſheets of this diſcourſe, which is as much as I now
<pb facs="tcp:172970:8"/> publiſh, I launched out I know not how or why, into things merely <hi>Philological</hi> and foreign to the ſubject, and as it is uſually, when men are got into a <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> they do but loſe themſelves the more for endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to get out, ſo one digreſſion bringing on another, I found I had wander'd ſo far out of my way, that the ſubjects I now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd my thoughts upon began to ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Language from that in which the former part of my diſcourſe was written.</p>
                  <p>They that have a Talent at cenſuring will be apt to ſay that this proceeded out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a certain vanity and affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of appearing learned, and it may be this was indeed the very cauſe, ſince it will be difficult to aſſign a better, though I am not ſenſible of it, and ſo far as I know any thing of my ſelf (but how few are there that do underſtand themſelves?) I have no ſuch thing as pride or affectation in my nature, and in truth it would be very inexcufable in me to be proud of any thing or to appear as if I were ſo, and much more to reſolve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly, in ſpite of the Subject or the Company I am in, to be talking of matters in which neither are concerned, becauſe this
<pb facs="tcp:172970:8"/> is an humour ſo tawdry and impertinent, and touches my imagination with ſo ſatyrical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon it ſelf, that of all things in the World it would appear the moſt deſpicable to me, if it did not make me ſick, as it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways does, and no man can properly be ſaid to deſpiſe that which he fears.</p>
                  <p>But whatſoever were the true reaſon of ſo extravagant a ramble from the ſubject and the Text, whether it proceeded out of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fooliſh oſtentation, or whether it were onely, what ſome that know me will be apt to plead in my behalf, that I am naturally inclined by my conſtitution to digreſs from every ſuch Subject which I undertake, which I believe to be a true account of the buſineſs, for I ſcarce ever ſet upon any thing in my life, but I was always peſtered with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of thoughts, as perfect ſtrangers to the Subject and to one another, as all the ſeveral barbarous and diſtant Nations of which the <hi>Ottoman</hi> forces are compoſed, who though they are all engaged upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon deſign, yet they underſtand not one anothers Language; I ſay whatever were the true occaſion of ſuch an irregular compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or whether Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> will referr
<pb facs="tcp:172970:9"/> it, beſides the two cauſes I have lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to ſome decay of mind, which my misfortunes may have brought upon me, yet thus much I know, that when I came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and compare the ſheets which I had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten together, I was very much aſhamed of what I had done, and very angry with my ſelf, inſomuch that I ſaw no hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled, but by throwing thoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that had made the difference, aſide, to try if that way it were poſſible the buſineſs might be forgotten, that ſo <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> who were at Mortal jarrs, might be brought to a better underſtanding with one another; for it is a very painfull and uneaſie thing for a man to be fallen out with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and if there be any torment more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite than another, a thing of which all the Philoſophers but the <hi>Scepticks</hi> are agreed, I am clearly of opinion that the ſhame and confuſion reſulting from a fooliſh and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent action is the worſt puniſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to humane nature.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I did, as it very nearly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me, uſe all the expedients I could think of or deviſe, and made all the friends I could poſſibly to my ſelf that the buſineſs might
<pb facs="tcp:172970:9"/> be timely made up, and, as the laſt remedy, I was reſolved to forget it and to employ my meditations upon ſubjects of another and a very different nature.</p>
                  <p>In this interval I writ that Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Laws of Nature and their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> which is now abroad, as the ſecond part of it lies by me ready for the Preſs, onely it wants tranſcribing, for it is written after ſo confuſed a manner that no <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor</hi> can deal with it at preſent; I writ alſo that Epiſtle, which followed, concerning the <hi>Marriage of Couſin Germans,</hi> which hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red great variety of cenſures not onely from the different capacity of its readers, but from their different intereſts likewiſe, for it is generally the nature of Mankind, that they will have nothing to be true which does not ſute with the circumſtances they are or would be in, albeit when things are imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidered I can ſcarce believe there are twenty men in the King's dominions that are concerned in point of intereſt or honour to believe what I have written to be falſe, and I have ſome reaſon to believe that the moſt conſiderable objection that lies againſt that <hi>ſhort</hi> Eſſay, is that it will be very <hi>long</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:172970:10"/> before any man who underſtands himſelf will be ſo hardy to undertake to anſwer it.</p>
                  <p>There was one indeed who had a deſign of that nature, and though I know not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet his character I do, and ſo will Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> likewiſe, when I ſhall have told you that it was the loyal, learned and ingenious writer of <hi>Conſtantius the Apoſtate,</hi> an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary whom though for his known ability I had reaſon to dread, yet having Nature and Antiquity ſo clearly on my ſide, I would have choſen ſuch an <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both becauſe in his <hi>advocation</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Couſin Germans,</hi> the utmoſt ſtrength of that cauſe would have been brought into the Field, which would have brought the matter on one ſide or other to a ſpeedy iſſue; and becauſe he was pleaſed to expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Letter of his which had no name at the bottom, with ſo much candour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity towards me, and indeed ſo far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any thing which I pretend to deſerve, that I was well aſſured that the controverſie would be managed on both ſides without any heat of words, with mutual kindneſs and civility toward each other, as becomes
<pb facs="tcp:172970:10"/> thoſe that know how to defend the truth without inſolence, and how to yield to it without ſhame, and that have joined the courteſie of Gentlemen and the charity of Chriſtians to the learning, judgment and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Scholars; but upon what reaſon I know not he afterwards deſiſted, as it ſeems, from his deſign, and I do not ſpeak this as if I would be thought to ſend him a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge by Your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> which it would be very rude in me to doe, but I would rather make it my humble requeſt to him, that he would ſuſpend his engaging in the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie againſt me, till he have heard all I have to ſay for my ſelf, and then if my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments will not demonſtrate what they pretend to do, I will as freely recant my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion as ever I maintained it, and give the World the reaſons why I have altered my mind; in the mean time I look upon my ſelf as bound in gratitude and juſtice to let Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> and the World underſtand, how much I think my ſelf obliged to ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious a man for his favourable opinion of me, and that I ſhould be glad to be as well acquainted with his perſon, as I am with his unqueſtionable loyalty and learning.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:172970:11"/>
                  <p>My Lord, I am very ſenſible that by what I writ upon that ſubject, I did incur the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of ſome for whom I have ſo great an honour, that I am very uneaſie under the ſenſe and apprehenſion of it, though I have done nothing but what I thought my duty at that time when I did it, and I ſee no reaſon yet to alter my mind; but theſe are the common inconveniences of humane life to which every wiſe and good man ought with a <hi>Philoſophical</hi> patience and equality to ſubmit, as I do, and am very perfect in that Leſſon, which by long practice I have taught my ſelf, of bearing with patience, as well the affronts and indignities of mine enemies, as the miſconſtructions and miſinterpretations of my friends, for ſuch I call all thoſe who are friends to our common freinds, the King, the Church, and the Religion eſtabliſhed, and that I might give no farther occaſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I have ſuſpended for a while the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of what remains upon the ſame ſubject, till the controverſie, not yet decided by my Lords the Delegates, have received its final period and iſſue by their judicious, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and wiſe determination.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:172970:11"/>
                  <p>And beſides theſe papers which have been either publiſh'd or are ready for the Preſs, and were ſome of them begun and others finiſh'd during that time of my retirement from my former ſtudies and to another end of the Town, there was another diſcourſe which lay by me imperfect, being an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatation upon that Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whereby the Brother or the next of kin was obliged to raiſe up ſeed to his deceaſed and childleſs Brother or Kinſman, a great part of which was written by me at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory to that other Treatiſe of the <hi>Marriage of Couſin Germans,</hi> which it is now a long time that my thoughts and ſtudies have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about, and being ſo much of it as was then done, tranſcribed in a very fair and legible hand, it was the greater temptation to me to ſend it to the Preſs, as I did, and have added ſo much to what I had written at the <hi>College,</hi> that it requires but very little to put a concluſion to it.</p>
                  <p>In this Diſcourſe, as I have conſidered all the caſes and circumſtances of that Law, with much more exactneſs than any have done before me, ſo I have particularly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd a conſiderable part of it againſt one
<pb facs="tcp:172970:12"/> Chapter of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his Book <hi>De Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionibus,</hi> and have very largely expoſed the vanity of the <hi>Rabbinical</hi> Learning, and the manifeſt unskilfulneſs of that ſort of men in the Antiquities of their own Nation; and if I have not found out a new Key to open and interpret the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, yet thus much at leaſt I have done, I have applied it to ſeveral Laws, to which it hath not been applied before, and have abundantly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the extreme impudence, as well as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the <hi>Aegyptian Moſes</hi> and other cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Maſters of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Learning.</p>
                  <p>I have likewiſe in an occaſional Eſſay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſubject demonſtrated the Antiquity of <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> and <hi>Dioceſan</hi> government in the Jewiſh Church, the dependence of the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Clergy upon the Biſhop of the Dioceſs, and the ſubjection of all the Biſhops of the Province of <hi>Judaea</hi> to the Arch-Biſhop, or High-Prieſt, at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> I have ſhewn that this was the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to which our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> being members of the Jewiſh Church, ſubmitted; and not onely ſo, but that the Jews had among them a <hi>Patriarchal</hi> dignity likewiſe, that is, ſuch Biſhops as having their uſual reſidence in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or in <hi>Judaea,</hi> had
<pb facs="tcp:172970:12"/> the care and inſpection of the Churches in the diſperſion, which was likewiſe imitated by our Saviour in his modell of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church; and certainly if their be no ſuch harm in a <hi>Patriarch,</hi> that is, a foreign viſitour or inſpectour, if this were imitated and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by our Saviour himſelf, then much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſs can there lie any exception againſt a <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick</hi> and <hi>reſiding</hi> Biſhop, to whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity likewiſe our Saviour ſubmitted, and conſequently approved of that ſort of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which I will grant in its firſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal to have been of humane inſtitution, if that will pleaſe our Diſſenters, for all they will get by it will be this, that our Saviour himſelf did allow of humane inſtitutions in the Chriſtian Church, and did ſubmit to them, and that this not being a part of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, ſo far as that Law conſiſted of types and ſhadows which were to be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, (as being fulfilled and anſwered by their antitype in the perſon and diſpenſation and ſacrifice of Chriſt) the reaſons of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience upon which this government was founded, remain ſtill the ſame, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there is no reaſon why it ſhould be altered though it had not been recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:172970:13"/> to us by our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s example, which may juſtly be thought to give it a <hi>jus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> though it had none before, for he was by no means a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and much leſs an <hi>Independent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet if this buſineſs be examined into the bottom, though the granting it to be of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inſtitution will doe the Separatiſts no manner of ſervice, it will be found that this government was inſtituted by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> both of which acted by divine appointment, and by conſequence it having nothing which was properly <hi>Judaical,</hi> that is, which was of a <hi>Typical</hi> or <hi>Symbolical</hi> nature, nothing that had any neceſſary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon or conexion with their Sacrifices and luſtrations and other Ceremonies of that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbratick</hi> diſpenſation, there is the ſame reaſon why it ſhould laſt after thoſe ſhadows were done away, as well as when they were lookt upon to be in full force, and were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the moſt indiſpenſably ſacred.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo in the ſame treatiſe demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the antiquity and the reaſon of the <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintenance</hi> by tithes, and I have ſhewn upon what account it was that the <hi>tenth</hi> of all the fruits of the Earth, and the encreaſe
<pb facs="tcp:172970:13"/> of Cattel was offered to God, and that the reaſon holds every whit as good to this day as it was either in the <hi>Levitical</hi> times or in thoſe that went before them.</p>
                  <p>And upon this occaſion I have conſidered very briefly the queſtion ſo much controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted concerning <hi>uſury,</hi> I have demonſtrated its lawfulneſs to all but the <hi>ancient Jews,</hi> and by the ſame clue I have opened a way to a better underſtanding of the <hi>Chronology</hi> of the times before the Floud, and ſo long after it as the age of man was reckoned to be an hundred and twenty years, and have beſides made it evidently appear what was the true meaning of the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But it being ſo ordered by divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that while I was employed in this kind of meditations, there fell a living void in this City, in the gift of the worſhipfull Company of <hi>Salters,</hi> I laid my antiquities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to try what intereſt I could make among them, for the obtaining their favour in the

                  <p>And the beſt expedient I could think of to ſave my ſelf harmleſs from the cenſures of men, with as little injury to the Book-ſeller as might be, (for I would have no man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon my account if I could help it) was after a retrenchment of ſeveral ſheets, which are now wholly loſt, and indeed were very unfit to ſee the light, to divide the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into two ſeveral parts, not ſuch parts as had a mutual connexion and dependence, but ſuch as are wholly what they are, by themſelves, without any manner of relation or affinity to each other.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of them is that with which I now preſent Your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> which all but the laſt ſix or ſeven pages hath lain by as it is, for at leaſt eighteen months laſt paſt, and is, if I do not very much miſtake my ſelf and it, not onely a very pertinent diſcourſe upon the ſubject it pretends to treat about, but a very
<pb facs="tcp:172970:15"/> unanſwerable one too, if any thing may be thought unanſwerable in an age where noiſe and faction ſupply the room of argument and reaſon, and where inſtead of being yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to as it ought to be by honeſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd minds, the more convincing any argument is, with ſo much the greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and fury it is oppoſed, and they that are able to ſpeak the leaſt good ſenſe will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be ſure to make the loudeſt noiſe.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:172970:15"/> ſeveral very famous antiquaries and men of the moſt conſiderable remark for learning have gone before me; but it will appear, I hope, by my diſcourſe upon that curious, though minute, ſubject, that they have all been miſtaken, and that the true ſecret hath been reſerved for me, a man by no means to be compared with any of them, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret and explain; but ſo it often happens that chance finds out what art and induſtry have in vain ſought after, and an accidental thought that wanders in the brain with all the undeſigning carelesneſs of a dream, may carry us directly to the diſcovery of ſome truth, which hath been courted in vain by the profeſs'd addreſſes of more ingenious and diligent inquirers.</p>
                  <p>In what I have ſaid upon the firſt of theſe, I have demonſtrated the onely true ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which St. <hi>Luke</hi> calls the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>t with from ſeveral very eminent ſcholars and very excellent perſons.</p>
                  <p>In my diſcourſe of the <hi>Tetragrammaton</hi> I have conſidered very largely the <hi>Tetractys</hi> of the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> School, and I think have ſhewn ſufficiently what a fondneſs it hath been in almoſt all the learned writers that have written upon the ſubject, to derive the latter of them from the former, and though in this I will not be ſo poſitive as in my other conjectures, yet thus much I will ſay of it, that I have bid very fairly for the diſcovery of the <hi>Tetractys;</hi> and whether I have or no, I make my humble appeal
<pb facs="tcp:172970:16"/> to Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> and other learned and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men that have a palate in matters of this nature, but to Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> in the firſt place, whoſe patronage it begs, and humbly implores the powerfull protection of ſo great a name againſt the rude aſſaults of ignorance and envy.</p>
                  <p>That which made me the more willing to publiſh the former of theſe exercitations was, that I was under an engagement to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick for a diſcourſe of that nature, it being no more than what I did expreſly promiſe in the <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory</hi> before the <hi>Sermon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> which it is now near four years ago that I preach'd before the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> of this famous City, and it was in obedience to that wiſe and venerable Court that it was afterwards printed; and it is a farther ſervice which I now pretend to doe to the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by ſetling the exact time of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's laſt Supper, which was a night before the <hi>legal</hi> Paſſeover was killed, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently was in imitation not of the <hi>real,</hi> which could not be killed before the uſual time, but of the <hi>Mnemoneutical</hi> or <hi>commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> Paſſeover, as <hi>Grotius</hi> calls it, wherefore
<pb facs="tcp:172970:17"/> the body of Chriſt, which is our Chriſtian Paſſeover, was not at that time <hi>truly</hi> eaten by the Diſciples, but onely a <hi>remembrance</hi> of it, a <hi>Proleptical remembrance</hi> it was, as it muſt needs be, being inſtituted by our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf,</hi> then preſent among his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as the <hi>Mnemoneutical</hi> Paſſeover among the <hi>Jews</hi> was a <hi>Poſtliminious</hi> commemoration. But of this notion of the true time of our Saviour's laſt Supper, ſo far as concerns the application of it, which in the papers I now ſpeak of, I have not medled with, I ſhall ſpeak more largely in ſome other papers, written <hi>ex profeſſo</hi> againſt that blaſphemous and abſurd tenet in another Language, which ſhall ſhortly be communicated to the World, and I hope will find a favourable acceptance in it.</p>
                  <p>But however wide a diſcourſe of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may ſeem to be from the ſubject of my Text, the occaſion of it was pertinent enough, for I was ſpeaking of our bleſſed Lord's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting himſelf, as became the Preacher and the Prince of peace, to humane inſtitutions in religious matters, which is an undeniable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that ſuch like inſtitutions are not in themſelves unlawfull to be complied with;
<pb facs="tcp:172970:17"/> for he preaches by his example as well as by his doctrine, and the occurrences of his moſt innocent and ſpotleſs life, are in many caſes, as clear teſtimonies of the divine will, as the expreſs declarations of his Goſpel; wherefore this <hi>Mnemoneutical</hi> or <hi>commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Paſſeover among the <hi>Jews,</hi> with all the peculiar rites and uſages belonging to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a matter perfectly of humane inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Law having onely enjoined the <hi>real</hi> one, or that which <hi>Grotius</hi> calls the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb facs="tcp:172970:18"/>
                  <p>But as it was not proper in a diſcourſe that was intended to have the ſhape and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a Sermon to launch out into ſo large a <hi>Philological</hi> diſquiſition, of which there are ſo very few of thoſe that hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons that can be ſuppoſed to be competent Judges, ſo indeed it was needleſs to give a particular inſtance, when our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, during the whole time of his ſojourning among men, is it ſelf an aggregate of a thouſand argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove the lawfulneſs of humane impoſitions; for without ſuch impoſitions there can be no communion, any more than there can be a City or Commonwealth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Laws, or a ſociety without ſome rules and orders to govern it ſelf by, the ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to which rules is that in which the very being of a ſociety conſiſts, and the breaking of thoſe meaſures by an univerſal diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a diſparking the ſociety, a pulling down the pale and barrier of the body politick, and a letting all things looſe into the ſtate of nature, that is, into a ſtate of tumult, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and diſorder.</p>
                  <p>For the other <hi>Diatriba</hi> upon the <hi>Shem Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meporaſh,</hi> as the <hi>Rabbins</hi> call it, or the <hi>Four
<pb facs="tcp:172970:18"/> lettered</hi> name of God, I cannot ſay that it came in ſo well, but rather muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it was too ſlight an occaſion which was taken hold of to entertain the Reader's curioſity upon it; but as it happens in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, if a man leave the company but for half a minute, he ſhall find oftentimes the diſcourſe as much altered when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns again, as if he had ſtaid away a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, or as if it were another company into which he was now fallen; ſo it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be in writing likewiſe, if a man do not keep a guard upon his thoughts, but allow his fancy a liberty of ranging, which it will eaſily do in a ſmall ſpace of time, over things at an infinite diſtance from one another.</p>
                  <p>However an eſſay of this nature conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by it ſelf, though it will not contribute any thing to the uſe of common life, yet it cannot be unpleaſant to any man to know for certain what the true pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of that peculiar name of God was, by which he is pleaſed to ſignalize and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh himſelf in an eſpecial manner from all created and dependent beings that are <hi>called</hi> Gods, but <hi>are</hi> not what they are <hi>called;</hi> that name whoſe true and genuine pronunciation
<pb facs="tcp:172970:19"/> hath been loſt for ſo long a ſucceſſion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for neither <hi>Joſephus</hi> nor <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> were acquainted with it, and the <hi>Jewiſh Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi> are generally agreed (which diſcovers how ignorant they are themſelves, and how unconſcionably given to impoſe upon others) that it was known onely to the <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> and never pronounced by him neither, but onely <hi>once</hi> a year, in the moſt holy place, when he brought his piaculary cenſer, within the vail upon the ſolemn day of expiation: For I have not onely ſolidly demonſtrated what the true pronunciation of this name was, but I have proved that there were other names of God in Scripture that were equally ſacred, though it is true they are owing to the <hi>ſame root</hi> from whence this is derived, and that it was not onely known among the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves but that alſo the heathen nations were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, for <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> in the ſacred volume mentions it expreſly, and <hi>Philo By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blius</hi> the tranſlatour of <hi>Sanchuniathon,</hi> a very ancient writer of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> ſtory, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the interval of the <hi>Judges,</hi> hath made it ſo far from being any ſecret that he hath long ago divulged it to the whole learned World.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:172970:19"/>
                  <p>If Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> ſhall demand of me, what it was that moved me, having ſuffered them to lie aſleep ſo long, to publiſh theſe papers juſt at this nick of time; there are two things which I preſume to offer as the reaſons why I took this opportunity, after ſo long a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, to let them come abroad and ſpeak for themſelves, and for the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> which they pretend to maintain, as well as for my ſelf, the writer of them, who having ſuffered ſo much upon their account, they are bound in juſtice to doe me what right they can, which I imagine they will ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently do by adventuring abroad and putting themſelves upon a fair and publick tryal.</p>
                  <p>One thing that moved me to publiſh them at this time was, that I thought they would be as much, or rather more ſeaſonable at this juncture than at that in which they were written, and for this I had not onely mine own opinion, but, as I may interpret it, Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s alſo, together with the concurring ſuffrage of all thoſe reverend, learned and judicious perſons, who are now employed, as I have been informed, by the particular appointment and direction of Your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> whoſe paternal care ſuffers no poſſible expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb facs="tcp:172970:20"/> to be unattempted, to procure the peace and unity of this Church, to ſatisfie the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, as many of them as act upon a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of conſcience, without deſign, in all the pretended matters of difference between us, and to clear up the miſty <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious doubt, which hath been raiſed by zeal, but is not yet diſpelled for want of knowledge; a deſign worthy of ſo great a Prelate, ſo truly pious, ſo profoundly wiſe, ſo indefatigably good, and ſuitable to the nobleneſs of ſo large a mind that hath joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo much perſonal honour and ſo much honour of inheritance together.</p>
                  <p>And though in the midſt of ſo many great performances, in which the ſtrength, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and prudence of the writers main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an equal combat with each other, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hope that mine will doe any thing which is not effectually done by ſome of theirs; yet I thought it my duty upon this occaſion not to be wanting to the common cauſe, and rather to betray, though I hope there is no danger of that, my want of skill or ability to maintain it, as it ought to be maintained, than of affection to ſerve it to the utmoſt of my power.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:172970:20"/>
                  <p>If I have been ſo fortunate to ſtumble upon any thing, which hath not been thought of or conſidered by ſome of them, it is a new mite caſt into the treaſury of the Temple, and ought to be accepted cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, not for its own weight, but for the chearfulneſs and good intention where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is offered, without which the rich Hecatomb is not of ſo much value, as the poor man's Turtle-dove or his handfull of flower.</p>
                  <p>If I agree with them in any thing, as I cannot imagine but I ſhall do in all, ſo as notwithſtanding the conceptions which are uttered may be <hi>materially</hi> different from one another, yet they will all bear their part in the harmonious conſort of our common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which is to perſwade to communion and to peace; this ought in reaſon to be looked upon, ſince we have not at any time compared notes together, nor have ever had any private conference at <hi>Sevill</hi> or <hi>Valadolid,</hi> or any other place, to be not ſo much the voice of prejudice as of nature, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where uniform and like her ſelf, and being attentively and heedfully conſulted will be ſure to pronounce the ſame ſentence,
<pb facs="tcp:172970:21"/> where the caſes themſelves are not different from one another.</p>
                  <p>But though all other conſiderations and motives ſhould deſert me, when I pretend to give a reaſon of publiſhing theſe papers, yet this I am ſure will not, that if by the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of my performance I cannot doe an immediate ſervice to the cauſe it ſelf, yet that cannot poſſibly ſuffer any diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from ſo obſcure a Champion for it, and I ſhall at leaſt doe a collateral ſervice by giving an advantage to others upon the compariſon; and therefore I beg of Your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> if I am not ſo happy to make a ſuccesfull attaque upon the enemies of our Church, who hold out obſtinately notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their arguments are anſwered, their trenches filled up, and their baſtions beat about their ears, yet that at leaſt I may be ſuffered to be a foil to its friends, and to appear in the company of thoſe for whom I have ſo great an honour and eſteem,

                  <p>But that which was the chief inducement to me to come abroad at this time, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:172970:21"/> a provocation which I could not reſiſt was, that to fruſtrate the deſign of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, when I appeared a candidate for the <hi>Salters</hi> favour, the memory of this Sermon was by mine enemies made uſe of as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt me; and though this ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme was far from having that malevolent influence upon the ſucceſs of my affairs which was intended, it appearing after all, that I had a very powerfull intereſt in that Loyal body, yet I had reaſon to take it very ill, that that which was an inſtance of my Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and affection to the government and the Religion eſtabliſhed, and therefore ought in juſtice to have been an argument in my behalf, ſhould be made an article of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt me: And for that reaſon I was reſolved to publiſh what I had written, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vindicate my ſelf, and partly that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing challenged at ſo bold a rate with that which was my duty, and was indeed mine honour, as if it had been an unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fault, not to publiſh it at ſuch a critical juncture, might be interpreted a diſowning of what I had done, which I abhor to think of, and have taken this courſe to purge and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my ſelf in the beſt manner I can, as
<pb facs="tcp:172970:22"/> well from the ſuſpicion of ſo deteſtable a baſeneſs, as from the guilt and blackneſs of the crime it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And as I was firmly bent upon this honeſt reſolution, thoſe words of our Saviour came into my mind, which he ſpake to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in his Sermon on the mount, and which have a particular reference to the Clergy in all ages, <hi>Ye are the ſalt of the earth, but if the ſalt have loſt its ſavour wherewith ſhall it be ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</hi> I conſidered that <hi>ſalt</hi> by naturalliſts was looked upon as the great principle of fixation and reſt, that by the ancients it was accounted a ſymbol of friendſhip, and a token of peace; and upon ſuch accounts as theſe, thought I within my ſelf, it cannot be that the <hi>Salters</hi> who are a Loyal body, firm to the King and the Religion eſtabliſhed, who are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to promote that peace and good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence among men which is the very life of trade, and the greateſt bleſſing of life, and by conſequence are zealous for that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity of divine worſhip, without which experience tells us there is no peace to be had; it cannot be that they who are thus diſpoſed ſhould be diſpleaſed with me for being like themſelves, ſo that inſtead of loſing any
<pb facs="tcp:172970:22"/> thing of my intereſt among them, I did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſe my ſelf abundance of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from the honeſty of this action; which if it be not otherwiſe rewarded, will ſit down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in the enjoyment of it ſelf, and will abundantly make up with inward ſatisfaction whatever it wants of any outward reward.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:172970:23"/> by caſting a tacit and ſuppoſed reflexion upon ſuch as dare ſtand up in defence of the Government and the Laws, as if they were not ſo good, or at leaſt not ſo wiſe as they ſhould be, and by giving at the ſame time a ſecret encouragement to the diſaffected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and party, as if their cauſe were ſuch that all the moderate and ſober ſort would ſide with them if they durſt, but dare not in Conſcience take part with the Laws againſt them.

<pb facs="tcp:172970:23"/> day, that the indifferent ſtanders by ſhall fare no better than he that made a ſtout and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute reſiſtence, onely there will indeed be this difference between them, that though the eſtates of the one and of the other are an equally tempting and inviting biat to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable avarice of ſucceſsfull treaſon, yet the courage, conſtancy and integrity of the one will even by the greateſt adverſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be remembred with honour, and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of with ſigns of inward veneration, when the puſillanimity and faintneſs of the other who can be friends to no body but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhall bring an unavoidable contempt upon their perſons, and make them reflect upon themſelves with ſhame, as well as be ſlighted and diſeſteem'd by others.</p>
                  <p>But of all men in the world a Clergy-man that is of ſo cold a compoſition is certainly the leaſt excuſable, becauſe he is under the greateſt obligation to confeſs God and his truth openly before men, he is not to gratifie any party by a tame compliance to the prejudice of the publick, nor to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe his own peace with the loſs of that of the Church, which can onely be maintained by wholeſom diſcipline and an eſtabliſht or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

<pb facs="tcp:172970:25"/> is an exception which I know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its enemies will make.</p>
                     <p>The friends of the Church perhaps will object againſt me, that my diſcourſe being chiefly levelled as it is all along againſt the <hi>Independency,</hi> whoſe name is <hi>Legion,</hi> being a thouſand different Hereſies and Sects under one title and denomination, this may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted as a ſuppoſed allowance of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> model; but as for that I think I have already ſatisfied the world what my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is, at the latter end of my diſcourſe concerning the <hi>Laws of Nature,</hi> and if I were to give a definition, or rather a deſcription of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> it ſhould be this, that it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ambitious and unruly <hi>Presbyters</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken looſe from the government of their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> and which though it be not <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> it ſelf, yet it is certainly the mother of it, for the ſame reſtleſs and unquiet humour which could not ſubmit it ſelf to the <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> conſtitution, will incline them in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> aſſemblies to contend for ſuperiority over one another; for where all are equal, and there is no tye of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the one to the other, nor any common viſitour or inſpectour indued with a
<pb facs="tcp:172970:25"/> power of diſcipline over them all, there it is natural for men that have paſſions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns about them to ſquabble, there it will unavoidably come to paſs that many will take it ill if they be not chiefly regarded, and if their opinion or determination be not the law and rule of the aſſembly, every man will be forward to ſpeak, and deſirous to govern, but loath to hear and unwilling to obey: The conſequence of which will be that it will occaſion parties and factions, while ſome take part with one and ſome with another, and this cuts the reins of diſcipline in ſunder, and does as naturally terminate in Schiſm and Separation, as the day is concluded by the night, or as fair and foul weather ſucceed one another; beſides that when men have once taſted the forbidden fruit of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which it is ſo natural for all mankind to hanker after, they ſeldom or never end where they begin, but go on farther and farther in pernicious attempts upon the good order and government of the world, till they have brought all things into abſolute confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>A ſubordination and dependence of one part upon another, is as neceſſary in one
<pb facs="tcp:172970:26"/> ſort of government as another, for though the Eccleſiaſtical and civil Society be in ſome ſenſe diſtinct from one another, yet in a Chriſtian Commonwealth they conſiſt both of them of the ſame perſons, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a ſociety is in both caſes the ſame; wherefore becauſe the State and the Church, the body politick and the body eccleſiaſtick, are both of them made up of the ſame mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, becauſe every man hath both a civil and an eccleſiaſtical capacity, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there ſhould be any diſorder in the Church which will not ſenſibly affect the ſtate; and the diviſion of a Commonwealth or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into infinite ſects and parties is a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the civil body as well as of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and every thing that hath a tendency to ſuch a diſſolution is in its proportion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and conſequently unlawfull.</p>
                     <p>So that if there were nothing more in the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> government, than what St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> the great, but very much miſtaken patron of the <hi>Presbytery</hi> hath allowed, namely that the ancient government of the Church, was by a parity of <hi>Presbyters</hi> (though no body knows when or where, nor is it poſſible to aſſign any age or place when and where it
<pb facs="tcp:172970:26"/> was not govern'd by Biſhops) but that in proceſs of time this <hi>parity</hi> proving inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, by being the occaſion of Schiſm and contention in the Church, then <hi>in toto orbe decretum eſt, ut unus de Presbyteris electus ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perponeretur caeteris, ad quem omnis Eccleſiae cura pertineret,</hi> I ſay, if there were nothing more but this in the buſineſs, yet this is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to aſſert the neceſſity, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of <hi>Epiſcopal Superiority</hi> in the Church of God; for the nature of things is owing to the authour of nature, and that which is beſt fitted to preſerve the World muſt needs be moſt agreeable to him that made it: and this is ſo true that let this ſort of Government be never ſo ancient, as I ſhall prove to Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> and the World that it was certainly the government of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and the government to which <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did themſelves ſubmit, yet its antiquity would be, as old things uſually are, too weak and infirm to be able to defend it, did not its uſefulneſs and manifeſt expedience to the good of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and of humane life, give it a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual youth and vigour, by which it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſtrong in its own defence, and will be
<pb facs="tcp:172970:27"/> too hard for its enemies to the end of the world; otherwiſe if any man can ſhew me fairly that either the <hi>Presbytery</hi> or the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency</hi> are more exactly calculated for the quiet of the world, notwithſtanding that the experience of our late times, added to the reaſon of the thing, and the opinion of Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> which was founded upon it, do ſeem at preſent to demonſtrate the contrary, I muſt beg Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s pardon if I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my <hi>Canonical obedience,</hi> for I muſt and will be either <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Independent</hi> as the nature of things would have me.</p>
                     <p>I ſpeak it with all imaginable deference and profound ſubmiſſion to Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act judgment, and that of my <hi>Superiours,</hi> I have conſidered of this matter with all the care and attention I am able, and I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if I can be certain of any thing, that I have diſcovered the <hi>Philoſopher's Stone,</hi> the true <hi>Elixir</hi> of Government and of humane life, which it muſt be our own fault in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting ſo great a bleſſing or by our diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience not anſwering the deſign of it, if it do not turn all things it touches into Gold, and make the whole earth as happy as the Paradiſe of God.</p>

                     <p>The true ſtate of the queſtion is in ſhort this, the end of government is obedience and peace, and therefore all ſorts of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon ſuppoſition that they are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted for the bringing of this end to paſs, would have an equal <hi>Jus divinum,</hi> an equal <hi>Jus naturale,</hi> an equal right of obtaining and continuing as they are in the ſeveral places and territories where they are in uſe; becauſe in this caſe nothing could make a diſturbance but an alteration, and therefore it would be with governments as it is with proprietours in the ſtate of nature, antecedently to any bargain or compact, the undoubted right would be <hi>primi occupantis,</hi> becauſe to deprive him of his poſſeſſion, who was already ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed of it, might occaſion an embroilment, might be the cauſe of bloudſhed and of war, but if every man would let his neighbour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone then all the world would be happy, and upon ſuppoſition that every man would be quiet and peaceable without it, that men could be ſo friendly, ſo happy and ſo ſecure without government as with it, there would be no need of government at all; but ſince man is by nature an ambitious, a neceſſitous, and conſequently a diſobedient, turbulent
<pb facs="tcp:172970:28"/> and encroaching creature, ſince he wants many things, and expects more than he wants, for this reaſon that form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is certainly the beſt which is the beſt fitted to command and force obedience: and this I affirm from the nature of things, for men do not willingly obey their equals, much leſs their inferiours, this I affirm from the conſent of mankind and the experience of all ages to be the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Government, or the <hi>Subordinate</hi> Politie both in Church and State; and if any man will undertake to prove the contrary, and will be as good as his word, then. I ſhall be for levelling as well as he, but till I ſee this ſubſtantially proved, which I have a ſtrong fancy I ſhall never do, ſo long as humane faculties or humane paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions continue as they are, I deſire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in my old poſt, and be content to move, though in the loweſt ſphere of this ſubordinate and comely frame, rather than by the perpetual jarring of equal powers and motions againſt each other, to go ſtooping like a Gooſe under a barn door, and be in perpetual fear, <hi>nè fractus illabatur orbis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was either the experienced or the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen miſchiefs of equality and independence
<pb facs="tcp:172970:28"/> that firſt introduced order and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the world, and it is the natural deſire of power in man, who is a needy, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ambitious creature, that endeavours to break this order and dependence for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of its own, without conſidering the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the publick; laſtly it is the unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confuſion, miſchief and calamity with which the breach of this order is attended, that uſually makes all parties (weary of thoſe miſeries which by ſtrife and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they have brought upon themſelves) return again into ſome orderly eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that may defend and ſhield them from the ſame calamities in the time to come; but there is no ſafety, no ſecurity, no quiet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a man's ſelf, his friend or his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion to be had but under the ſhade and protection of ſuch a ſubordinate ſtate of things, in which the very life and being of ſociety conſiſts.</p>

                     </p>

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Concerning the particular impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are the occaſion, or pretence, of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Church of</hi> England.</p>
                     <p>Let him then enter the liſts as ſoon as he pleaſes, and I promiſe Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> I will not fail to anſwer him in defence of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd Religion, and for the quieting the
<pb facs="tcp:172970:34"/> minds of his Majeſtie's good ſubjects againſt either the tricks or the miſtakes of inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or deſigning men; not that I pretend to be able to ſay much more upon theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects than I have done already, but ſome men will not be convinced by any thing at the firſt hearing, let it be never ſo plain, but they muſt have it over and over in other words and in a new appearance, till by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the truth is rendred ſo familiar to them as to ſubdue the prejudices they have imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed againſt it, or the miſtake ſo palpable, that obſtinacy begins to bluſh and be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                     <p>And the better to prevent all artifice and cant, which do but perplex the cauſe and make all controverſies endleſs, and cheat the world of their money and their time, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all ſquabbling about authorities, which is an incompetent way of arguing in this caſe, becauſe men that are not able to ſearch into theſe things themſelves will be ſure to believe the quotations of their own ſide, whether true of falſe, or whether they be rightly applied or not. For this reaſon I propoſe that we lay all arguments but thoſe of nature aſide.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:172970:35"/>
                     <p>For if it be found upon principles that are univerſally acknowledged, and ſuch as make their appeal to every common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that Epiſcopacy, that is, a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority on the one hand, and a dependence on the other, is the moſt perfect form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment both in Church and State, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that there can be no laſting govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without it; that in the Church it ſecures the greateſt reverence to the Clergy, by which they are the better enabled to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the people, and by conſequence to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the end of their inſtitution and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the miniſterial office; if it give the greateſt incouragement to learning, if it ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the hands of diſcipline, as well with reſpect to the inferiour Clergy as the Layety, and if this be a natural means to ſecure the publick peace, then here is all that can be expected to juſtifie this form of government in the Church: and though the teſtimonies of antiquity may receive ſtrength and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from the nature of things, which is the onely true immutable antiquity to which we muſt appeal, yet thoſe very teſtimonies, let them be never ſo numerous, unanimous and poſitive, when they have nature againſt
<pb facs="tcp:172970:35"/> them, what are they but ſo many confeſſions of ignorance or deſign? of want of honeſty, or want of skill?</p>
                     <p>So alſo in the ſecond enquiry, if it ſhall be found that humane impoſitions in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matters are of abſolute and indiſpenſable neceſſity for the keeping any eccleſiaſtical ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety together, for the preſervation of peace and unity among men; if it follow plainly from the conſideration of humane nature and humane paſſions, as well as from the experience of our own and former times, that without ſuch impoſitions we muſt crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into ſects as numerous as the motes that lie basking in a beam of the ſun, or that lie basking in a beam of the ſun, or that infinity of crowding ſtars by which the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Galaxy is adorned: this is abundantly ſufficient from the neceſſity of ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inſtitutions, to juſtifie their lawfulneſs, and to prove their obligation; and it is ſo far from being true, that there can be no external circumſtance of religious worſhip appointed and ordained by men, which is not expreſly revealed and ſet down in ſome place or other of the New Teſtament, that if on the contrary our Saviour and his Apoſtles had expreſly told us that we muſt not ſo
<pb facs="tcp:172970:36"/> much as move an hand or a foot in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious aſſembly or affair without expreſs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and authority from them, which they have no where done, and yet at the ſame time had not adjuſted the particular inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our behaviour in theſe matters, which they have not done neither, all the inference that could have been made from this would be, that we muſt not worſhip God at all, which is a very odd ſort of divine revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Beſides that, nothing can be more foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh than to perſwade to charity, to talk per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually of peace and love and ſuch like luſcious and delicious things, onely to make our mouths water, while at the ſame time we are deny'd the neceſſary means of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo deſirable bleſſings to our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>It would be true at this rate not onely in the event but in the deſign too, that our Saviour <hi>came not to bring peace but a ſword,</hi> and the end of his coming, if he had any at all, being onely to ſet the world together by the ears, as it muſt be if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the civil or eccleſiaſtical magiſtrate a power of determining thoſe indifferent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which he hath not any where deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb facs="tcp:172970:36"/> himſelf; this would be a plain argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he was a groſs impoſtour, inſtead of being, as he is, the prince of peace, and the moſt powerfull preacher, as well as the moſt perfect example of obedience.</p>
                     <p>From all which it follows unavoidably as to the third enquiry, which is concerning the particular ceremonies or impoſitions that are excepted againſt, that it is abundantly ſufficient that there is a great deal to be ſaid for them, but nothing at all that can with any ſhew of reaſon be objected againſt them; and to except againſt a ceremonie without giving ſome other reaſon, than onely that a man cannot comply with it, or becauſe he is not ſatisfied with its lawfulneſs, though he knows not why it ſhould be unlawfull nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is an indefinite ſort of exception that extends to one ceremonie as well as another, and with as good reaſon may be applied to all humane impoſitions whatſoever: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſs the magiſtrate will utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt himſelf of all kind of power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity whatſoever, as all is included conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in this power of humane inſtitutions in religious matters, he muſt lay down this as an unalterable rule and meaſure of proceeding
<pb facs="tcp:172970:37"/> never to diſpenſe with any thing that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, merely becauſe his ſubjects are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the <hi>Mulligrubs,</hi> becauſe they know not what they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l, or what they would be at, or why they would have what they complain of altered and diſpenſed with; for this is to give up all into the hands of fancy, and which is ſtill more dangerous, of deſign, and it is the ſame thing as if a Phanatick or his wife ſhould long for a Crown jewel, not that they intend to make any uſe or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it, but onely it is a pretty thing, and the good woman will miſcarry if ſhe have it not, for it is certain if they be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this requeſt, they will long for all the jewels one after another, and at laſt for the Crown and the prerogative themſelves.</p>
                     <p>I am very far <hi>(My Lord)</hi> from going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to detract from the great and worthy performances of thoſe who have ranſacked antiquity to vindicate and defend our church, either againſt the Romaniſts on the one hand, or the Separation on the other; but yet it cannot be denied, that this inſtead of ending the controverſie hath but had the unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to render it more perplext and difficult than before, and to ſwell the diſpute into ſo
<pb facs="tcp:172970:37"/> large a compaſs that it is no more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with an ordinary leizure, than with an ordinary education and capacity to conſider it: however it is of abſolute neceſſity that this be done, that the onely pretences to antiquity may not lie on the wrong ſide; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that after we have done our beſt, when the beſt parts and the moſt accurate endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours have been employed, men that are not Judges of theſe things for themſelves will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be cheated by their own writers than convinc'd by ours, and the writings of <hi>Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, Salmaſius</hi> and <hi>Davilleé,</hi> not to ſay any thing of that <hi>Kidderminſter</hi> ſtuff, which as courſe and as unfit for ſervice as it is, is the uſual wear of the Schiſmaticks of our times, will always be in better eſteem among ſome men, if there be no other expedient uſed to convince them, than the moſt irrefragable and unanſwerable demonſtrations of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Divines, who are either more able or more honeſt, or both of them, than they.</p>
                     <p>And though when antiquity does but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the true notion of things, or rather is it ſelf ſtrengthened and confirmed by them, it be in a manner needleſs, yet when either the ancients themſelves are on the wrong ſide
<pb facs="tcp:172970:38"/> of nature, or are miſapplied through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, inadvertency or deſign to ſerve a turn, there is nothing ſo odious, ſo diſtaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the palate, and ſo diſagreeable to the ſtomach of a wiſe man, as to ſee a page groan under a heap of quotations, and a margent as full fraught with teſtimonies to no purpoſe, or to a very bad one, as an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range ſtuck with Cloves, or a Pheaſant lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Bacon.</p>
                     <p>But where time and reaſon are both of them of a mind, there indeed is it a double ſatisfaction to us to ſee that our anceſtours before us were wiſe men, and that we tread in their ſteps, but the true reaſon why we ought to follow their example, is not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they gave it, and for nothing elſe, for then we may follow bad examples, as well as good ones; but becauſe their practice and ours is alike founded in the reaſon of things, and the intereſt of mankind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nature is unchangeable and always the ſame, and becauſe experience cannot deceive us, though antiquity may.</p>
                     <p>I have therefore choſen, becauſe I am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the venture is very ſafe, to put the ſtreſs of the whole controverſie between the
<pb facs="tcp:172970:38"/> ſeparatiſts and us upon this iſſue, that we may ſtand or fall as nature ſhall determine, and that we may proceed upon ſuch principles as every man may judge and feel for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf whether they be true or no.</p>
                     <p>If it be better for us to let looſe the reins of Government, without reaſon and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, as faſt as any man that hath a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen face, or a weak underſtanding, or a ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter deſign, ſhall come and ſay, <hi>My Conſcience is tender, and it is but fit that Conſcience ſhould be heard</hi> (whether ſhe can ſpeak any thing for her ſelf or no,) then let us let them looſe, to make an experiment what the event will be, if former experiments will not reſolve the caſe; but if it be better to keep up an uniform and ſtrict diſcipline, if the intereſt of all be to be preferred before the humours of a few, and thoſe of the meaneſt of the people, both for their quality and underſtanding; if all the fault of epiſcopal government and of humane inſtitutions is, that they are not ſubmitted to or obeyed as they ſhould be; if this be a fault, not of the government or of the inſtitutions themſelves, but, of thoſe that boggle at them and quarrel with them for no reaſon, and if the ſame humour and
<pb facs="tcp:172970:39"/> itch of diſobedience may be as good an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt any government in the world, and againſt all inſtitutions whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; if the Epiſcopacy be the beſt fitted to ſecure obedience, and to keep up diſcipline, to preſerve peace and to reward merit, to make us happy and wiſe into the bargain, Then it is but fit and neceſſary that we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue as we are, and that without regarding peeviſh and unwarrantable ſcruples which can have no good influence, and will admit of no bounds or limits to reſtrain them, we encourage one another to ſtand to our old poſt, and ſay to each other, remembring the <hi>ſignaculum Crucis</hi> which we have received in token of our being ſouldiers under the ſacred banner of the Croſs, as the <hi>Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſaid to his <hi>Enſign</hi> in <hi>Livy,</hi> when the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate was deliberating whether or no they ſhould remove to <hi>Veii, Sta ſignifer, ſtatue ſignum hic manebimus optimé.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this way of procedure I am the more ſatisfied with, becauſe it gives me a new aſſurance of the univerſal influence and undoubted truth of thoſe principles which I have formerly laid down to be the ſquare and meaſure of obligation, and which being
<pb facs="tcp:172970:39"/> applied to any particular caſe, will in every thing reſolve what is true or falſe.

<pb facs="tcp:172970:40"/> this nature, that the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> conſtitution as being found by experience to be the moſt wholſome for the preſervation of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches health, and for the preventing all thoſe maladies and diſeaſes to which the body <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick</hi> would otherwiſe be expoſed, is therefore unqueſtionably the beſt that can be thought of, and hath beſides a right of immemorial preſcription, the advantage of long experience, which in matters of this nature, is the moſt powerfull reaſon, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to us.</p>
                     <p>It is with government in the body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, as it is with medicines in the natural, the end of medicine is health, and the end of government is obedience and peace; and therefore though it does not follow becauſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> or <hi>Galen</hi> in a caſe propoſed made ſuch or ſuch a <hi>recipe,</hi> conſiſting of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, and compounded in ſuch propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions together, that therefore the Phyſicians of our times whenever the ſame caſe occurs muſt of neceſſity preſcribe after the ſame manner, for we muſt examine not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the preſcription it ſelf, but alſo into the ſucceſs of it with reſpect to the patient, we muſt compare patient and patient, and
<pb facs="tcp:172970:41"/> then patient and preſcription together, we muſt allow for the difference of climate, conſtitution and diet betwixt one patient and another, and if when all theſe things have been conſidered, ſuch a courſe of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, or ſuch a method of cure in ſuch a caſe propoſed ſhall be found to have been ſucceſsfull in the time of thoſe old Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and ever ſince, here is an <hi>Empirical</hi> demonſtration which cannot eaſily deceive us, what we are to doe at this time of the day, and in this caſe antiquity joined to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is a very powerfull argument in behalf of the preſcription or the method given, and look how much greater the antiquity is, and how much more frequent the caſes that have occurred, and the good ſucceſs that hath all along attended them have been, ſo much the ſtronger is the argument which is drawn from antiquity in their behalf, not ſo much for the ſake of the antiquity it ſelf, as for the ſucceſs and good fortune of the courſe that hath been taken.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the end of phyſick being health as the end of government is good order and obedience, and the fitneſs of means being to be meaſured by their ſuitableneſs to that end
<pb facs="tcp:172970:41"/> to which they are directed, it is manifeſt that experience muſt determine the controverſie in both caſes, and as that phyſick, or that diet or that air, is certainly the beſt, which hath the moſt wholſome and ſalutary effects, upon the natural body, ſo is that ſort of eſtabliſhment or polity whether in Church or State un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the beſt, which hath always been found to be moſt productive of peace, moſt powerfully influential upon obedience and good order, and the beſt fitted to prevent the inconveniences with which the want or abſence of government would be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the queſtion is this, what ſort of government is that which is moſt for the Churches health, and peace, and ſafety? is it a co-ordinate adminiſtration, or will it be better, for the obtaining of theſe ends, that its government, as it is in the body na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and in all other political bodies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, do not conſiſt of parts that are all of them of equal dignity or power, but that one part be dependent upon another, and that the whole be knit together by a ſteady and regular ſubordination?</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:172970:42"/>
                     <p>Let us put the caſe in an army, can that army be well governed all whoſe officers have equal power and dignity with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? or did not the rebels themſelves in the late unhappy times, when they raiſed an army, and levied an unnatural war againſt their king, did not they make this difference in the commiſſions which they gave, that ſome were to be <hi>Generals,</hi> others <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant Generals,</hi> others commanders of <hi>Tertia</hi>'s or <hi>Brigades, Colonels</hi> of <hi>Regiments,</hi> and ſo down to <hi>Captains, Lieutenants</hi> and <hi>Enſigns?</hi> now either this depended upon the nature of government in the general, or it did not; if it did, as what is an army but an armed commonwealth or city ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to certain rules of diſcipline and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence within themſelves? then the nature of government is in both caſes the ſame, and conſequently a ſubordination in the church militant is every whit as neceſſary for the preſervation of its unity and peace, as it was in the ſchiſm either militant or trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant. But if it do not depend upon the nature of government and ſociety conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the general, then there is no reaſon why an army may not be managed by a
<pb facs="tcp:172970:42"/> parity of officers, which if it could once be effected it would ſave a great deal of that unneceſſary expence, which is now thrown away, as it ſhould ſeem, to no purpoſe upon the great field-officers and the commanders in chief whether of whole Regiments or greater parties.</p>
                     <p>To carry this compariſon a little farther, becauſe the power of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> in our times is pretended to be ſwallowed up in that of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> like the rods of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians</hi> by the rod of <hi>Moſes,</hi> contrary, as it ſeems, to the practice of the primitive times, we may obſerve that in the affairs of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate company, it is but reaſonable that the captain ſhould adviſe with the reſt of the commiſſion-officers, and not manage all things wholly by himſelf, but yet the power of ſummoning and diſſolving the aſſembly is ſtill entirely in him, and he hath a <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> at leaſt, entirely to himſelf, ſo that without his conſent and concurrence no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done, as to all thoſe things that are within the cogniſance and ſphere of his authority, but if the commander in chief of the whole regiment were to conſult with his officers for their common intereſt and
<pb facs="tcp:172970:43"/> ſafety, it is moſt likely that he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe onely with the captains of the reſpective companies, and in a great council of war, where ſo great a multitude would breed confuſion, there the private captains are not regarded neither, but onely the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:172970:43"/> an inſpection over them and over the whole dioceſe, as they had over their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular charges, but ſtill the Biſhop had his <hi>negative</hi> and conſequently almoſt the whole power of adminiſtration in his own hands; for otherwiſe than this I can by no means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the language of St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> who though in this he be ſo widely miſtaken that he will not have this government to have been ordained in the church by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet he confeſſes that it was as old as the contentions between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> and that it was made uſe of as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to reſtore the churches peace, which I think to be a very apt tranſlation of thoſe words, <hi>ut ſchiſmatum ſemina tollerentur,</hi> but now what peace there could be, or how this was a poſſible expedient of procuring it, where the Biſhop had not a <hi>negative</hi> voice in the aſſembly, I confeſs I do not underſtand.</p>
                     <p>Again as no laws could be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the epiſcopal <hi>Le veult,</hi> and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary all proceedings were ſtopt in every particular dioceſan aſſembly by the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>ſaviſeroit</hi> of the Biſhop, ſo as to thoſe canons and conſtitutions that were enacted, the Biſhop was the perſon who was chiefly
<pb facs="tcp:172970:44"/> concerned to look after their performance and to puniſh their neglect; and as no eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſanction could be made without him, ſo the executive power was in a manner entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his, he was to ſee that every paſtour did his duty, he was to cenſure and puniſh the delinquents againſt it, and in a controverſie ariſing whether this or that particular paſtour had broken his canonical obedience or no, or done any thing which was diſagreeable to his function or his obligation, the laſt dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan appeal was to the Biſhop, and without gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him as much power as this comes to, it is utterly impoſſible to make ſenſe of the words of St <hi>Jerome, in toto orbe decretum eſt, ut unus de presbyteris electus ſuperponeretur caeteris ad quem omnis Eccleſiae cura pertineret, ut ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſemina tollerentur;</hi> for how the biſhop could be ſaid in every dioceſe to be ſet over the Presbyters, how the care of the whole church or dioceſe could be ſaid to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, and that for this end, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the peace of the church, or how that peace could be preſerved without all this power which I have allotted to him, <hi>fateor me ſcire juxta cum ignariſſimis,</hi> and if there be any man elſe that can explain it to me,
<pb facs="tcp:172970:44"/> let him paſs from hence forward for the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Diver</hi> or for the <hi>Delphick Apollo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But though in this or that particular dioceſe the power of the Presbyters ſeems to have been ſomewhat greater than it is now-a-days, and yet, as I have proved, it was not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable neither, yet as the Biſhop did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with his Presbyters as to the affairs of his own dioceſe, and perhaps did ſcarce doe any thing of moment without their concurrence and direction in it, ſo in the <hi>Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods</hi> which were convened together for the more regular and uniform adminiſtration of ſeveral ſuch dioceſſes together, both as to matters of diſcipline and belief and much more in the <hi>general councils</hi> or <hi>oecumenical dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets</hi> of the whole Chriſtian Church, the whole affair was tranſacted by the Biſhops, and yet the canons and conſtitutions that were then agreed upon were obligatory to all the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters within the juriſdiction of thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of which the aſſembly conſiſted, and theſe conſtitutions did without queſtion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the moſt important caſes, they appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a remedy to all the greater evils of the church, and laid down all the moſt general and moſt concerning rules of diſcipline and
<pb facs="tcp:172970:45"/> obedience, ſo that the conferences of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Biſhops with their particular clergy, ſo far as any thing new was eſtabliſhed or enacted by them were onely about particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſes which could not be ſufficiently fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen or provided for by the larger aſſemblies, and for the moſt part about matters of leſſer moment.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as ſmall a ſhare as they had in the government of the church, for it appears upon more accounts than one to have been but very ſmall, yet being uſed upon ſo frequent occaſions to adviſe with their Biſhop, and the Biſhop not being uſed to determine any new matter or iſſue out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new order without their conſent, this was in proceſs of time, an occaſion of the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> aſpiring after more power, of their confronting and oppoſing their <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and taking upon them more than became them or than was for the peace of the Church, which ſeems to have given occaſion in part to <hi>Clemens</hi> his epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and to <hi>Ignatius</hi> his ſo frequent and ſo paſſionate exhortations to the Presbyters to pay that duty and obedience which they owed to their Biſhop, as the meſſenger of God and the
<pb facs="tcp:172970:45"/> vicegerent of Chriſt in that particular dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe wherein he was placed, but when all theſe endeavours of good and holy men, proved ineffectual, as all exhortation is inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual with the generality of mankind, where there is not a power ſufficient to force obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, it ſeemed good at laſt to the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Church, to remove the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſuch evils for the future by enlarging the power of the Biſhop, and to curb the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of the Presbytery by removing its cauſe, which was their meeting together with him in the dioceſan convocation upon any occaſional emergence that might happen; but yet the Biſhop was not by this means rendred abſolute neither, but there lay an appeal from him to the Metropolitan or Patriarch, to a provincial or oecumenical dyet, and to the ſtanding canons and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the church, which it was not in his power to violate or alter, and in which all the great lines of obedience, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>And this alteration in the government of the church depended upon the ſame reaſon with the diſanulling <hi>popular elections</hi> either of <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>particular</hi> paſtours, which being
<pb facs="tcp:172970:46"/> found by long and wofull experience to be the occaſion of perpetual tumult and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the church, the fruitfull parent of everlaſting feuds, animoſities and factions to the unſpeakable detriment both of church and ſtate, was in proceſs of time partly diſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of it ſelf by the peoples being weary of ſo troubleſome a right, and partly by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>imperial</hi> reſcripts, and by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the civil laws of our own and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations.</p>
                     <p>It was very natural in the beginnings of the church to allow ſome what more to the Presbyters in conſultation with their Biſhop, and to the people in the choice of both, than was conſiſtent with the policy of after-times becauſe,

<pb facs="tcp:172970:46"/> intereſt of Chriſtianity; but when the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Chriſt had taken deep root in the world, when the temptations of honour and preferment, and the dangers of perſecution from the Pagan powers were now utterly removed and extinguiſhed, and when at the ſame time, the world being turned Chriſtian, the dangers and inconveniences of popular elections increaſed with the number of the electours, and the Presbytery by reaſon of their number began to be formidable to the Biſhop, as well as troubleſome and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous among one another, which muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity have been the occaſion of very great calamities, and very ſad as well as frequent revolutions if a timely ſtop were not put, this made it neceſſary upon the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of convenience to abrogate this power, upon which it ſeems firſt to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, if indeed it were introduced upon any reaſon at all but onely a gradual and inſenſible encroachment in both caſes, and upon the <hi>ſupinity</hi> in or neglect of the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the church, who did not poſſibly foreſee thoſe horrid inconveniences with which this way of management would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards be attended.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:172970:47"/>
                     <p>For my part I am ſo firmly of opinion, that the great deſign of religion is charity, good-will and peace, that I take it to be a certain argument of an inſtitution or cuſtome eſſentially bad when it is directly calculated for the diſturbance of the world, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becomes of the antiquity of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is uſed to afford matter of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſcourſe on both ſides of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſeveral important caſes and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in theſe which I have ſo lately mentioned; yet if it could be proved that antiquity and intereſt were fallen out with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is in this caſe but reaſonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the longer we and our fore-fathers have laboured under the painfull and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial conſequences of errour, the more it would behove us to think of a reformation, which if it be not allowed to be a good argument in behalf of truth, the Proteſtant Religion will be utterly unable to defend it ſelf; and we ſhould conſider likewiſe that even in point of antiquity, nature, and the ſtanding intereſt of the world are much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter things than any the oldeſt cuſtome can pretend to be, and therefore if antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be the meaſure by which we are reſolved
<pb facs="tcp:172970:47"/> to proceed, it will follow that nature and intereſt muſt preſcribe to cuſtome and not cuſtome to them.</p>
                     <p>Nay, if it could be never ſo demonſtrably proved that our Saviour did by his example or by his inſtitution recommend to poſterity the <hi>presbyterian</hi> modell, or the <hi>congregational</hi> way, though it can hardly be ſuppoſed that he who was <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>man,</hi> could be guilty of ſo great a miſtake in the true art and myſtery of government, yet theſe being found afterwards by experience to be very inconſiſtent with the great end of the Goſpel, which is charity and peace, it is manifeſt that the means having onely a relative or conditional nature, and being to be either uſed or rejected in proportion to their fitneſs or unſuitableneſs to their end, the end of the Goſpel, which is peace, would have obliged poſterity to alter that inſtitution, though of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, which was found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be inconſiſtent with it; or rather, ſince the declared deſign of our Saviour's coming into the world was to reconcile God to men, and men to one another, and ſince the cauſeleſs feuds and animoſities of men do ſet them at enmity with God, as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb facs="tcp:172970:48"/> themſelves, ſince they extinguiſh that calm, ſerene and charitable ſpirit, without which neither our perſons nor our ſacrifices can be accepted, ſince it is impoſſible, in the language of St. <hi>John</hi> to <hi>love God whom we have not ſeen,</hi> unleſs we can alſo <hi>love our brother whom we have ſeen,</hi> this would have been a plain argument, when he preached peace and yet eſtabliſhed ſuch a form of government as had a direct or a comparative tendency to confuſion, one of which is the caſe of the <hi>Independent</hi> churches, and the other of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> form with relation to the more perfect and compleat eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Epiſcopal ſubordination;</hi> I ſay, it would have been a plain argument either that he had <hi>war in his heart,</hi> notwithſtanding that <hi>his words were ſmoother than oyle,</hi> and that though he talked of peace, yet he deſigned conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe if he were ſincere in what he did, that he did not underſtand the meſſage he came about, and in either of thoſe caſes he muſt be acknowledged to be a groſs impoſtour, when he pretended to be ſent from God, for God ſends no man to diſturb the world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be for our ſins, as other great plagues and calamities are inflicted, but how was he

                     <p>Or may it not be conſiſtent, even with the meekneſs of a Chriſtian ſpirit to call for fire from heaven upon ſuch bold miſcreants that pretend a commiſſion from it to unhinge the world, and to ſet all manking together by the ears, onely for the ſake of two or three <hi>ſigniſicant ceremonies,</hi> and becauſe they are <hi>ſignificant,</hi> that is, becauſe they tend to that which they plead ſo much for, and talk ſo loudly concerning, that is, <hi>edification,</hi> for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe what they <hi>ſignifie</hi> I cannot imagine, and I entreat ſome of them to tell me.</p>
                     <p>And yet if theſe things were abated, it is not to be hoped without a ſevere proſecution of the penal laws, that ever the ſeparation will ceaſe together with them, which under the diſguiſe of religion is indeed nothing elſe but a <hi>Republican faction,</hi> which the enemies of <hi>monarchy</hi> will be ſure to cheriſh ſo long as they can or dare, ſo that it is obſervable though they have been driven fourty times from one
<pb facs="tcp:172970:50"/> ſtation to another, and though they know not where to fix to entrench themſelves ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the aſſaults of truth, though the pleas alter almoſt with the ſeaſons of the year, and with the returns of the day, yet the ſeparation it ſelf continues ſtill the ſame, or hath rather been every day more obſtinate and inveterate than the other, till the laws began to rouſe their drowſie heads, and ſhew that they were not merely a <hi>dead</hi> and lifeleſs <hi>letter,</hi> which it is natural for a <hi>Phanatick</hi> to deſpiſe.</p>
                     <p>Nay, though there were not, as there is, in the bottom of <hi>Phanaticiſm,</hi> a <hi>Republican</hi> deſign, yet what terms of accommodation can poſſibly be expected, when there are ſo many whoſe onely trade is ſchiſm, and who get the very bread they eat by keeping up their party; whoſe kitchins muſt be cold and bellies empty, whenever that fatal day ſhall overtake them, in which the Conventicles are not full and reeking with the unnatural ſteams of ſeparation.</p>
                     <p>However ſuch is the wiſe temperament and conſtitution of the church of <hi>England,</hi> that it hath left the <hi>Presbyters</hi> no reaſon to complain, inaſmuch as they are not obliged
<pb facs="tcp:172970:50"/> by any <hi>Canon</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical ſanction</hi> to which themſelves have not given their free and full aſſent in convocation, by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives at leaſt, if not in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which is exactly the ſame ſort of aſſent which the free ſubjects and free-holders of <hi>England</hi> give to thoſe laws which are enacted in Parliament, their conſent being included in that of their Knight or Burgeſs, and the major part of the repreſentatives including the whole, as reaſon and cuſtome do require in all aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of this nature, is at the ſame time inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted as the act of the commons of <hi>England,</hi> who are repreſented in the whole aſſembly.</p>
                     <p>But it is eaſie to ſee by the diſorders that frequently happen in ſo ſmall a number, what confuſion it would make, if all the people or the free-holders of <hi>England,</hi> were actually to have a vote in the paſſing of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very law, as by the diſturbances which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten-times happen in the <hi>Livery,</hi> which is a ſmaller body, in the <hi>Guild-hall</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> it is obvious to any man at the firſt ſight how much more intolerable the miſchief would be if all the freemen were admitted to a right of ſuffrage, from whence to avoid thoſe confuſions they are now excluded.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:172970:51"/>
                     <p>And the ſame tumults and diſorders would no queſtion happen if all the Clergy-men in <hi>England</hi> being in both orders, were admitted to a liberty of voting in the convocation, for Clergy-men have paſſions and deſigns too, as well as other men, and being ſuppoſed by their function to be of the wiſer and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neder ſort, this naturally makes every man the more zealous to betray his ignorance, when he cannot ſhew his wit or underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; he will be ſure to make up in noiſe and buſtle what he wants in knowledge, and it will always happen in this caſe, that the Biſhops and the wiſeſt and beſt men will be born down with the crowd of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Clergy, who being men oftentimes of little maintenance and as little parts, will as naturally comply and ſide with the humour of the people, as it is natural for the people themſelves in all nations, as often as they can or dare to affront their governours, and diſobey the laws, which however juſt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable in themſelves, and however well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and proportioned to the happineſs of thoſe to whom they are preſcribed, they look upon as yokes, that are not to be born and will be ſure to break them as if they were ſo.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:172970:51"/>
                     <p>To which it is to be added, that where ſo many are concerned in the diſpatch of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, beſides the feuds and contentions, which different humours, intereſts and deſigns would create, it would occaſion infinite delays and difficulties in their proceedings, which would often times prove fatal to their deſigns, and utterly diſappoint the end of their coming together.</p>
                     <p>And what hath been ſaid of the whole Clergy's meeting in one or in the two ſeveral and diſtinct convocations of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> the ſame inconveniences would in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion attend the dioceſan aſſemblies, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch were practiſed, wherein the Biſhop had no greater power than onely to be as it were the <hi>Chairman</hi> or <hi>Prolocutour</hi> of the Synod, but could not move one foot himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of a majority of the members of which it was compoſed, eſpecially in ſo populous a dioceſe as Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s is, where the power and intereſt of a factious Clergy-man may be of ſuch diſmal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the peace of the church; but ſuch is Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s paternal condeſcention, mixt with an exact judgment and profound wiſedom, that You have found out an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb facs="tcp:172970:52"/> temperament betwixt the authority of the Biſhop on the one hand and the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous power of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> on the other, by admitting your Clergy to ſo frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and familiar debates concerning the common intereſt of the church, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective good and advantage of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular charges, yet ſo as not to admit them to a liberty of controlling their Biſhop, or inveſt them with a power which may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to bad purpoſes as well as be made uſefull and ſerviceable to good ones, of which though at preſent there can be no danger, in a dioceſe ſo well ſtored with men equally conſpicuous for integrity, prudence and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for loyalty to the King, and obedience to their Biſhop, and love to one another, and care of their particular charges and flocks, yet that may be pernicious and deſtructive in its example which is not ſo in it ſelf, and power when it is once given to the beſt of men, is not ſo eaſily taken away from worſe that may happen to ſucceed them, as it may be employed to purpoſes very contrary and oppoſite to thoſe for which it was intended; otherwiſe there is no queſtion but it is the indiſpenſible duty of every Biſhop, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb facs="tcp:172970:52"/> a conſtant intercourſe and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with his Clergy, that he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtand, as well them, as the dioceſe which he is to govern, and may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enabled to make a judgment of both, and accordingly to proportion the expedients of publick peace and ſafety with a wiſe and skilfull hand; and that he may conciliate that love and reverence to his perſon by the affability and obliging ſweetneſs of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, without which all power is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and force, and will not onely be reſiſted but overcome. Wherefore I pray God that the church may always be bleſt as long as time ſhall endure, with ſuch faithfull, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and prudent Biſhops as Your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> and with ſo pious, learned and obedient a Clergy, as that in which this dioceſe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and the whole nation in general is at preſent happy.</p>
                     <p>But what it is that they mean who would extend the power of the Presbyters with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to their Biſhop any farther than this, or who declaim ſo loudly for the peoples right in the election of their paſtours, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly conceive, unleſs it be that they do ſeriouſly deſign and purpoſely intend to
<pb facs="tcp:172970:53"/> bring us all into confuſion, which it is not much to be doubted but there are ſome that do, or that being engaged in an intereſt they are aſhamed to retract their errour, and therefore graſp at all arguments how weak ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to defend it, which it is very natural for mankind to doe; or laſtly, that they are not ſo wiſe men as they would be thought to be, and that they do not ſee into the pernicious conſequences of ſo miſchievous a doctrine, which ſtands condemned by the unalterable decrees of nature, and by the fundamental maximes upon which cities are built, and by which humane ſociety is ſupported.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould be ſorry to perceive my ſelf thus inſenſibly engaged in ſo long a diſquiſition concerning the natural grounds upon which the epiſcopal government relies, very much contrary to my firſt intention which was far from any thought of treating ſo diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as it were <hi>ex profeſſo</hi> at this time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject, did I not hope to doe ſome ſervice to the church by giving an account of my ſentiments upon it, and were I not poſſeſſed with a very great inward aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that this way of procedure in the matter under debate, that is, by an appeal
<pb facs="tcp:172970:53"/> to the Principles of nature and to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental maximes of ſociety, whether it be civil or eccleſiaſtical, or of what kind ſoever, is that which is liable to the leaſt exception, and is by conſequence the moſt certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible expedient of bringing thoſe with whom we have to doe, to a ſenſe of their duty and an acknowledgment of their miſtake; which if it could be done, it would be happy for us all, and therefore with Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s good leave I will proceed to what remains, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my ſelf humbly to the things that have been or ſhall be ſpoken upon a queſtion of ſo great importance, to intercede with Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> and all that ſhall reade this Preface in my behalf, if by my too great length I have offended,</p>
                     <p>Wherefore to improve the compariſon of an army, that is, an armed city or ſociety, yet a little farther, for it is not yet ſtretched out to its full length, ſince it appears ſo plainly by the conſent of all ages and by the conſtant practice of the world, that ſuch a body of men cannot be managed by a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of officers, the next thing to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is whether the imparity or ſuperiority of one officer over another be conſiſtent with
<pb facs="tcp:172970:54"/> an equality of ſalary or revenue? and for this we have the ſame univerſal experience and conſent, that the pay of the greater officers is proportionably larger according to their reſpective dignity and place, and the ſame is to be ſeen in civil as well as military em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, that the great officers of ſtate, the Judges of the law, and miniſters of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick juſtice, according to their reſpective dignity and ſuperiority over one another, ſo are the penſions and advantages annext to their employments for the moſt part propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably greater; and if the church ſo far as concerns the general nature of a ſociety be the ſame, and do as naturally require an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity of officers as either the civil or milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubordination, ſo do the ſeveral impari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of dignity and power as unavoidably call for an inequality of revenue, the reaſon of which in all the three caſes is this, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are uſed to pay a reverence to their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, not ſo much for their own ſakes, as for the ſake of ſome outward appearance, formality and ſhew, for hoſpitality which they keep, and for the train and equipage that attends them, and therefore this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fault of the Presbyterian government
<pb facs="tcp:172970:54"/> with hath not yet been mentioned, that it can never be ſo readily obeyed by the people, becauſe it wants thoſe outward appearances of magnificence and ſplendour, which are the natural cauſes of reverence and eſteem among men, and which it is much more eaſie for them to obey, than to ſubmit themſelves to the <hi>diſciplinarian</hi> rigour of ſuch as are upon the level with themſelves; for this is deeply rooted in the very nature of government, that men will always pay a reverence to the port and grandure of thoſe that are placed over them, but if you deveſt them of their trappings and attendance, they loſe their authority together with them, and will as infallibly be deſpiſed, as ever they were eſteemed or reverenced before.</p>
                     <p>It is true indeed that power without wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will loſe it ſelf, and will unavoidably produce either hatred or contempt, by ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny on the one hand, or by too much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and ſoftneſs on the other; but it is every whit as true that though wiſedom be that for which all mankind have a natural inward reverence and veneration, yet whether it be from emulation, or ambition, or whatever be the cauſe, but ſo it is in experiment,
<pb facs="tcp:172970:55"/> which is the ſureſt way to diſtinguiſh truth and falſhood in theſe matters, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a wiſe man is uſually diſregarded, where the ſplendour and appearance of a great one is wanting, at leaſt thus much muſt be acknowledged on all hands to be true, that a wiſe and good man with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of honour and preferment ſuitable to his worth, is capable of doing more good in the world, and of influencing mankind more powerfully by his authority and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, than he that wants thoſe advantages to recommend him.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the great ſtreſs of the queſtion lies here, is it at all neceſſary that there ſhould be any ſet apart to the office of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, that is to ſay, to be the preachers and examples of obedience and good life? If it be not, if we are ſo governable and ſo good of our ſelves that we ſtand in need of no monitour to put us in mind of our duty, I ſee no need at all we have of any Clergy to inſtruct us; for at this rate every man would be a Prieſt to himſelf, his life would be the beſt of Sermons to men, and the moſt powerfull and effectual prayer to God; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual examples would preach to one another,
<pb facs="tcp:172970:55"/> they would encourage and approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they would excite and animate each other, and the earth would be as happy as heaven it ſelf, the habitation of the bleſſed, and the ſeat of glorified and immortal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                     <p>But ſince the caſe is clear otherwiſe, ſince it appears by every days experience that the world is overrun by luxury and vice, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil habits, and by bad examples, by ſtrife and faction, by animoſities, contentions, quarrels, feuds and emulations; ſince theſe are the great plagues of humane life, and ſince the removal of theſe, or at leaſt the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating, as much as is poſſible, of their malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and deſtructive influence, is the greateſt bleſſing and benefit that can befall us, and yet a task ſo difficult to be performed, that all the zeal and diligence of the beſt and the wiſeſt men is little enough to bring ſo happy and ſo deſirable an event to paſs, it follows unavoidably from the conſideration of theſe things,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> that it is naturally neceſſary that in every nation there ſhould be a regular and ſtanding Prieſthood, whoſe buſineſs and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment it ſhould be to perſwade to charity,
<pb facs="tcp:172970:56"/> good-will and friendſhip, to preach obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, repentance and amendment, and to exhort to a conſtant and aſſiduous practice of all whether perſonal or political vertues, which are the onely expedients of publick and of private peace.</p>
                     <p>And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> that for the better enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the doctrine which they preach, they ſhould have an honourable ſubſiſtence dealt among them, leſt otherwiſe their perſons and their functions fall into contempt, which they cannot doe without detriment to the publick, if it be true, what cannot without abundance of waywardneſs and wilfulneſs be denied, that ſuch an order of men is at all uſefull or ſerviceable to it.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe all greatneſs is in it ſelf not an abſolute, but a comparative thing, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that the grandeur of the Clergy, muſt be taken in proportion from the other parts of the government, that ſo all the parts of the civil and eccleſiaſtical ſtate may have a ſymmetry with one another; for inſtance, there ought to be a Biſhop of a dioceſe as well as a Lord Lieutenant of a County, a metropolitan of more dioceſes taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well as a <hi>Praetor, Proconſul,</hi> or <hi>Baſſa</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:172970:56"/> of a Province, and a patriarchal, as well as an imperial ſeat having ſeveral ſuch Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under its juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of which is founded in the nature of ſociety, and in the unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maxims of the trueſt policy, that there ought always to be a proportion and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony inviolably preſerved betwixt the civil conſtitution and the eccleſiaſtical; and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to any man of common underſtanding whether, beſides the envy and oppoſition that ſuch an eſtabliſhment would meet with, it would not be ridiculous and monſtrous in the body politick, for any Clergy-man to challenge or arrogate to himſelf the ſtate, revenue and equipage of a <hi>Patriarch</hi> in an <hi>Hans Town</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> or in one of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient commonwealths of <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Greece;</hi> or whether it would not as infallibly be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual deviation from the rules of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if in a large Empire converted to Chriſtianity, ſuch as the <hi>Roman</hi> was of old, after the time of <hi>Conſtantine the great,</hi> no Clergy-man ſhould be higher than a <hi>Pariſh Prieſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have very frequently in my mind deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that <hi>Phanatick</hi> argument againſt Popery,
<pb facs="tcp:172970:57"/> (God keep us from ſuch defenders of the Proteſtant Religion) that <hi>Paul</hi> worked with his own hands, and <hi>Peter</hi> was a poor fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, great in nothing but his faith and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and in the ſupernatural gifts that were beſtowed upon him; whereas his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſucceſſour in the <hi>Apoſtolical chair,</hi> as he is, at this day, a very great temporal Prince, rowling in wealth, and armed with power, and furniſhed with all the <hi>Regalia</hi> belonging to the Triple Crown, ſo he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes at leaſt a ſpiritual authority over all the Princes and potentates of the Chriſtian world.</p>
                     <p>For though I do not believe the Pope or any Biſhop to have ſuch a power over Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as that they may depoſe them, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve their ſubjects from their allegiance, or that they can commiſſion any to hurt or annoy their ſacred perſons, and much more to deſtroy or kill the Lord's annointed, to whom our Saviour and the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have given us ſo powerfull examples and ſo frequently inculcated Precepts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, whoſe perſons are and ought to be inviolable by the laws of nature, and by the unalterable conſtitutions upon which all
<pb facs="tcp:172970:57"/> humane ſociety is founded, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be at peace within it ſelf, if the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign be accountable to any power but of God.</p>
                     <p>And though I do not think there can be ſuch a thing in nature as an univerſal Biſhop, any more than there can be an oecumenical Monarch whom all mankind ſhall obey, it being an unmanageable and unwieldy charge which no one man can poſſibly undergo with ſo much care and vigilance as is intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and eſſential to the duty of a Biſhop; yet thus much I believe, that let a temporal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion be as large as it will, it is neceſſary to the ends of an eccleſiaſtical ſociety, which is to provide for the peace and unity of all its members, that as there is one King or Monarch over the whole, ſo there ſhould alſo be one Patriarch or Metropolite, to whom all the reſt of the Biſhops ſhould be in ſome ſort accountable, and upon whom they ſhould have a dependence, as their reſpective dioceſes are accountable to themſelves, and as the particular flocks are likewiſe to pay a ſpiritual obedience to the ſeveral paſtours or presbyters that are placed over them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by this means it comes to paſs that
<pb facs="tcp:172970:58"/> the government is all of a piece, and the unity of the church, which is Chriſt's body, is preſerved, by the members being fitly framed together, as well with reſpect to one another, as to their head.</p>
                     <p>Without this it is impoſſible to prevent ſchiſms and contentions in the church, and by conſequence troubles and revolutions in the ſtate, or at leaſt there is not all the care taken to prevent them, which humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and foreſight might have uſed; and for the ſame reaſon that there are ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and inequalities in power, there ought alſo to be a like diſparity in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward formalities of ſecular appearance and greatneſs, otherwiſe the eſtabliſhment of ſuch a ſubordinate power will be a deſign that will not take effect, an eſtabliſhment that can neither be ſo ſtrong nor ſo laſting as it is intended to be.</p>
                     <p>For as obedience is the cauſe of peace, ſo are reſpect and reverence the moſt natural and the moſt laſting cauſes of obedience, and it is that which they call the <hi>Typhus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularis,</hi> the <hi>pomp</hi> and <hi>vanity of this wicked world;</hi> as <hi>vain</hi> and as <hi>wicked</hi> as it is, it is a ſhew of grandeur, an appearance of power,
<pb facs="tcp:172970:58"/> a plentifull table, a numerous dependance, and a long train of moenical ſervants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to a wiſe man, who knows how to make uſe of theſe things for the good of the world, that is the moſt certainly produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive cauſe of reverence and reſpect; it is that which, bating the terrours of the rods and axes, and ſetting the fears of puniſhment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, hath a <hi>magnetick</hi> nature to attract obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and a power of perſuaſion to make it an eaſie and a voluntary thing: Whereas though it be true that no ſociety can ſubſiſt without fear, yet it is true likewiſe that it can never poſſibly be ſtrong and laſting, unleſs that fear be tempered by eſteem and love; and as the latter of theſe without the former would be every whit as unconſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain as the changeable humour of a fickle miſtreſs, ſo would the former divorc'd and ſeparated from the latter, be in its ſubject the vaſſallage of ſlaves, and in its object the barbarity and fierceneſs of a cruel tyrant, which will not be endured any longer than needs muſt.</p>
                     <p>For man is naturally a diſobedient crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore when he feels himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed and oppreſt, there is his intereſt added
<pb facs="tcp:172970:59"/> to his natural inclination to prompt him to rebell; but when a government proceeds by wiſe and ſober meaſures, though every man would be glad to be uppermoſt himſelf, yet when he ſees a moral impoſſibility lying in his way, that ever he ſhould arrive to the top of his deſires, and when he can propoſe greater and more certain advantages to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by obeying his ſuperiours than by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring or murmuring againſt them, this creates in him an artificial or a ſecondary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to be content with his condition, and to obey the authority that is placed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him; and ſtill the wiſer any man is, the more he conſiders the miſchiefs of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſad effects of confuſion, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter likelyhood that there is of loſing his own fortune in the publick ſcramble, than of getting another man's, beſides the tenderneſs that all men have for life, and the folly of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring with the moſt dreadfull dangers upon an improbable proſpect of advantage, and this makes him the more willing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to acquieſce in preſent things, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to himſelf no other than ſuch advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as may be acquired with the good leave of the government, and with conſiſtence to his duty.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:172970:59"/>
                     <p>But where the mold and frame of the conſtitution it ſelf is ſuch, that men are in a manner upon a levell with their gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and do by conſequence univerſally deſpiſe them, here is a conſpiracy ready for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, without the <hi>White-horſe conſults</hi> or the <hi>Wild-houſe caballs,</hi> to reſiſt and overthrow it, and the general diſpoſition which is in all to diſobey, makes the government it ſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious and uncertain, which was the great fault of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> eſtabliſhment; for, beſides that equality is the parent of diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the eternal ſource of ſtrife, animoſity and contention, and breaks out unavoidably into independency, anarchy and confuſion, I ſay beſides this, men do not ſo eaſily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to the diſcipline in <hi>Cuerpo,</hi> as to the ſolemnity of the preſent conſtitution, and to the grave and fatherly reproofs or cenſures of a wiſe and learned Biſhop; ſo that what they wanted of the natural cauſes of obedience, they were forced to ſupply by ſeverity and rigour, or rather, every thing ſeems like rigour and ſeverity, where we have a mean or no opinion of the perſons that command, for every thing they enjoin hath the force and appearance of tyranny
<pb facs="tcp:172970:60"/> and uſurpation, and arbitrary government, when the governours placed upon the levell with our ſelves do not look as if they had a natural right to challenge any duty or obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from us.</p>
                     <p>The contrivers of this modell were very ſenſible of this diſadvantage, and therefore the better to reconcile the people to it, they very wiſely called their lay-neighbours in, to come and take upon them a ſhare of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; the lay-elders were to rule the Pariſhes and to fill the conſiſtories, and the people, which is without queſtion a very fine ſort of government, were to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by themſelves, not conſidering that as lay-men neither are nor can be fit judges in eccleſiaſtical matters, ſo in the general they do not underſtand ſufficiently the nature of laws and the deſign of puniſhment, they have not ſufficiently conſidered the wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions and temperaments of mercy and juſtice, they have not for the moſt part ſuch a ſenſe of humanity, or ſuch a comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five proſpect of the intereſt of the world, and of the natural iſſues and reſults of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions, as is requiſite to qualifie them duely for the charge of being publick cenſors
<pb facs="tcp:172970:60"/> and perpetual ſuperviſors over the belief and manners of their brethren; but it oftentimes comes to paſs that he who is the richeſt man in a Pariſh, and by that means puts in moſt powerfully for a mongrell Presbyter, is very far from being either the wiſeſt or the honeſteſt in that circuit, and if he be of an inſolent humour, as many of that ſort are when they get into power, for want of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and liberal education, (beſides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional frailties which are common to all men) if his temper be rather overweening than overwiſe, and if he have gotten his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate by injuſtice and oppreſſion: I need not ſay what an excellent government we are like to have, when men thus qualified are got into the ſaddle, the thing ſpeaks but too plainly and too loudly for it ſelf, ſo that this device though a very proper expedient, till the inconveniences of it began to be experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, to cully in the vulgar to a comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with this promiſing modell, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as if it were intended to make all men governours, yet upon experiment it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be found to be one of the true cauſes that will for ever render the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment an <hi>odious</hi> and an <hi>intollerable</hi> thing.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:172970:61"/>
                     <p>It is abſolutely impoſſible that any ſort of ſociety, be it civil, be it ſacred, or of what kind ſoever, ſhould ſubſiſt, without ſome laws to govern it ſelf by, or without cenſures and puniſhments in caſe of diſobedience; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the unity of the church depends very much upon that of the Clergy, who are its officers, among themſelves, therefore it is very natural for a man to ask this queſtion,

And I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it is beſt it ſhould be intruſted in the hands of ſuch overſeers as ſhall be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for that purpoſe out of their own num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and that for two reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that all mankind do moſt eaſily, moſt willingly and readily obey thoſe of
<pb facs="tcp:172970:61"/> their own order and profeſſion, the reaſon is becauſe all men have a paſſionate love for themſelves, which though they will not own at every turn, yet we may diſcern it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a fondneſs which they are ſubject to expreſs for the moſt faint reſemblances of themſelves in others; a tradeſman or artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, ſetting other conſiderations, which are nearer him, aſide, hath a greater kindneſs for one of his own trade or company, for a brother, as he calls him, of his craft and profeſſion than another; a mariner would chuſe to be commanded by a captain like himſelf that hath been bred in a ſeafaring life, and a ſouldier had rather ſerve under an old beaten officer, that perhaps was once a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſouldier, like himſelf, than under ſome novice or unexperienced youth who hath nothing but a great birth and fortune to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him, nay he would take the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt diſcipline in good part from ſuch an one, when yet if the other ſhould inflict the ſame ſeverity for the ſame offence it might cauſe an embroilment and diſorder in the army; if they mutiny for want of pay, the promiſe of ſuch an one that he will look after it, ſhall ſignifie more with them than if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:172970:62"/> had paid them down half their arrears, they will follow him chearfully into the greateſt dangers, and though it be at him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that they have taken perhaps a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable and juſtifiable diſpleaſure, yet his bare preſence and appearance among them ſhall have a wonderfull eloquence to perſwade them to be quiet, it is like old friends and lovers that are fallen out, they are glad on both ſides to accept of any offers of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe there is kindneſs at the bottom, and they have a complacency in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Upon the ſame account it is, that men that are far from home are uſed to be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily pleaſed when they meet with a country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of theirs, and much more with one of the ſame town or neighbourhood with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, although it may be when they were at home, they had no knowledge of him; and let them be where they will, yet if a man in his childhood have been but playfellow or ſchoolfellow, if it ſo happen that he was born in the ſame pariſh or neighbourhood with another, who is famous for any art or skill, or is arrived to any great honour or preferment, the man whenever he talks of
<pb facs="tcp:172970:62"/> it is almoſt as proud and as well pleaſed as if himſelf had been the very perſon that is ſo wiſe, ſo skilfull or ſo great, and if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had been to prefer one into the ſame dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or high emploiment, ſuppoſing that he had no greater intereſt to conduct his choice, he would infallibly prefer his countryman or his townſman before any other competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour whatſoever, merely becauſe he is ſo, and becauſe of a certain imaginary reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and likeneſs with himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus men that are of kin to greatneſs do reap a pleaſure and ſatisfaction from it, though they have neither honour nor eſtate themſelves; and they who in a mean fortune are yet deſcended of an ancient and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtock, do take a pride in thinking <hi>fui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Troes,</hi> and for the likeneſs which they fancy betwixt themſelves and their progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours they attribute all <hi>their</hi> honours, <hi>their</hi> actions, <hi>their</hi> endowments, <hi>their</hi> vertues, <hi>their</hi> ſucceſſes in ſome ſort to themſelves.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, a Monk hath uſually a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for his own order, a ſcholar hath the greateſt kindneſs for thoſe that are skilfull in his particular attainments, for his own Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, his own Univerſity, and every man
<pb facs="tcp:172970:63"/> hath a comparative fondneſs for every thing and perſon, wherein either nature hath made or education painted the leaſt imaginary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of himſelf.</p>
                     <p>To which it is to be added, that thoſe honours and preferments which the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the body eccleſiaſtick, being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves members of the ſame body, enjoy, as they are very natural and very certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients of procuring reverence and eſteem to their perſons, and by conſequence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them fitter for the end of government, which is obedience; ſo they are ſo far from being grudged or repined at, by the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Clergy, that they do naturally rejoice in them, and as they do in ſome ſenſe enjoy thoſe honours and thoſe preferments for the reaſon of ſelf-love and ſelf-likeneſs which hath been lately mentioned, ſo the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them inſpires them with gallant thoughts and vertuous deſigns to make themſelves capable of the ſame rewards and dignities in time to come: for it is certain that all great attainements in any kind what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever are owing to an honeſt and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ambition, and Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> ſaith ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where excellently well, <hi>niſi qui laudem amant,
<pb facs="tcp:172970:63"/> pauci faciunt laudabilia,</hi> ſo we may ſay with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual truth, <hi>niſi qui ambiunt honores, pauci fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt quae ſunt honoribus digna.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf bids us look to the <hi>recompence of reward,</hi> and <hi>preſs toward the mark for the prize of the high calling,</hi> and it is certain that no man will or can doe any thing with a ſteady purpoſe of mind, wherein he does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome intereſt to himſelf. The proſpect of ſuch advantages in future, makes a man obedient, as well as induſtrious for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and by ſetting an example of ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his ſuperiours, and of diligence in his ſtation and emploiment, he is in both reſpects an inſtrument of great honour and great ſervice to the Church; he is in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to make a wiſe and excellent perſon, and will be the more readily obeyed when he comes to govern, for having ſhewed an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of obedience before.</p>
                     <p>But if there were not ſuch honours and advantages to be met with in the Clergy, then there would certainly theſe two notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inconveniences follow, firſt that the governours of the church would loſe very much of their authority and power, which they cannot do without prejudice to the
<pb facs="tcp:172970:64"/> government it ſelf, and ſecondly, that the want of due encouragement would produce in the inferiour Clergy, a ſcorbutick idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inactivity, a want of due concern either for the peace of the Church or for the honour of it; it would ſubject them to the humours of the people, from whoſe kindneſs they might in this caſe expect as great or greater ſecular advantages than they could propoſe to themſelves in any other courſe, ſo that inſtead of being the inſtruments of obedience, they would by this means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſpeaking trumpets of faction; and ſo it was ſeen in the late diſorderly times, when the Epiſcopacy was demoliſht, and the dignitary lands were all of them confiſcate, men preach'd up rebellion for lecture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, and I doubt not but many of them acted much againſt their conſciences for no other reaſon but to pleaſe the rabble.</p>
                     <p>It is an old ſaying <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, it is not to be denied but there are ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of very gallant men to be found in the reformed churches abroad, and that too where they have not the benefit of epiſcopal government, but I dare appeal to the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themſelves, if they will ſpeak their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
<pb facs="tcp:172970:64"/> whether ever there was ſo plentifull an harveſt of wiſe and excellently learned men as are to be found at this day among the Clergy of the church of <hi>England,</hi> and whether among themſelves there be any ſuch thing as learning to be met with, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both city and country are not now bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter furniſhed than in the late times, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent preachers, and men that can ſpeak ſenſe, which is more than they can doe, or whether the Univerſities are not better ſtored with men of great attainments on the one hand, and great hopes on the other, than in the days when humane learning and that abominable idol carnal reaſon were for the moſt part baniſh'd with the King and the Biſhops; the reaſon of which cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be referred to any other cauſe, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the more ingenuous Principles that are now abroad, and the greater encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments men have now before them to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and take pains, and deſerve well of the world.</p>
                     <p>This is certain, that the wiſedom of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hath always been ſo ſenſible of the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of <hi>eccleſiaſticks</hi> to the ſervice of the publick, for the ſecurity, honour and ſafety
<pb facs="tcp:172970:65"/> of their governments, for the compoſing and calming the minds of their people into a peaceable and obedient temper, that they have thought no honours and advantages too great to beſtow upon them as a reward of their merit, and to make their authority ſtill greater in the eyes of the people; and it was very wiſely provided by our anceſtours in ſuch a government as this is, where the people have ſo great a ſhare in the making of thoſe laws by which they are afterwards to be obliged, that the Biſhops ſhould have a place allotted them in Parliament, as well as the nobility or the commons have, and that for their greater honour, and to give them a right of ſuffrage in the houſe of Lords, they ſhould have Baronies annext to their reſpective ſees.</p>
                     <p>For where the people have ſo great an intereſt in the enacting of their own laws, there, if the Clergy be totally excluded, if there be none admitted into the aſſembly to look after the intereſt of the eccleſiaſtical ſtate, it will moſt certainly and unavoidably come to paſs, that by the envy or the ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of men the Clergy will be depreſt and trampled on at ſome time or other, which
<pb facs="tcp:172970:65"/> it can never be without detriment to the ſtate, upon ſuppoſition that they are at all advantagious or ſerviceable to it.</p>
                     <p>Nay, if it be granted that they are of any uſe, it muſt be granted likewiſe that they are the moſt uſefull perſons that do or can belong to a ſociety, and therefore ought to be the moſt highly honoured and eſteemed; for what greater bleſſing can there be than peace? or what greater plague or calamity can befall a nation than to be embroiled in ſedition, enflamed with ſtrife, raging with oppoſite and eager paſſions? what better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments can there be in any ſtate or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than they whoſe buſineſs and whoſe ſtudy it is to exhort to peace, and charity, and obedience, to ſubmiſſion to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and love to one another?</p>
                     <p>Certainly if the <hi>Lawyers</hi> get ſo much, and are ſo highly careſſed and rewarded ſometimes for ending controverſies, and ſometimes for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them endleſs, ſometimes for ſetting men together by the ears, and at others for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the fray to the diſadvantage of the true pretender; the <hi>Divines</hi> are much more worthy to be honoured and rewarded, whoſe buſineſs it is to prevent all ſtrife and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:172970:66"/> and who have perhaps determined as many controverſies in a cheap and amicable way at home, as ever the other decided at the bar, to the ruine ſometimes of both the parties concerned, and always to the ſignal detriment and diſadvantage of one.</p>
                     <p>I do not ſpeak this to diſparage or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the learned Gentlemen of the long robe, whoſe profeſſion I acknowledge in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſtate to be not onely uſefull, but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to its peace and welfare, ſo far as it is not abuſed by ill men, or by tedious delays, and by traverſing of courts and actions, to the infinite vexation and oppreſſion of the ſubject. But, I ſay, the prevention of all ſtrife is a much more noble, excellent and uſefull thing, than the deciding of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies after they are actually begun, as it is better to prevent an ague by a wholeſome diet, or by a regular courſe of life or by preventive medicaments before hand, than to remove the fit, or by degrees perhaps the diſeaſe it ſelf, by many repeated doſes of the Jeſuites powder, which when it hath had its utmoſt operation, there will ſtill be ſome dregs of the diſeaſe, and ſome of the very medicine it ſelf that was intended to cure it,
<pb facs="tcp:172970:66"/> that will remain behind; and ſo it is in law, though the ſuit be ended, yet the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding parties are not reconciled, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry going to law, which is the remedy of ſtrife, does oftentimes beget a quarelſome and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious temper, and make men more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to their neighbours for the future, whether they get the better of the cauſe or no; as loſing gameſters play on out of hope to repair their loſſes, and they that win ſo long as there is money ſtirring upon the board, or an eſtate to anſwer the credit which they give, are every whit as eager as the other, out of hope that fortune will continue to be kind.</p>
                     <p>And as the Prieſthood for their uſefulneſs excell the courts of juſtice, inaſmuch as it is a much more noble and more worthy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment to create in men an obedient and charitable temper, by the one of which they ſhall converſe with the greater kindneſs and benevolence among one another, and ſhall be ready at all times to hearken to truth and reaſon, and to ſubmit their cauſe to the um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirage of common intereſt and univerſal juſtice, without reſpect to private ends or perſons, and by the other they are rendred
<pb facs="tcp:172970:67"/> more tame and tractable, and more eaſie to be governed, and in both reſpects contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſo much to the peace, and happineſs, and ſafety of each other; I ſay, as this is an emploiment undoubtedly more excellent than that which is chiefly converſant about the cure of diſeaſes and the deciſion of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, after the mutual hoſtilities are begun, and hath a much greater recourſe to force than to perſuaſion, ſo it is likewiſe in the order of nature before it, and in both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects it is, that the Prieſthood in all nations are not onely worthy of double honour, but it is abſolutely neceſſary to the ends of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that they ſhould have it.</p>
                     <p>But yet I do not deny, nay, I have already expreſly granted and affirmed it, that it is a part of our buſineſs and duty to reconcile differences as well as to prevent them, as it is on the other hand a part of the counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours emploiment to prevent quarrels by deeds of ſettlement and by antecedent agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſtipulations conſented to by both parties in due form of law, as well as to end them by bringing them to an iſſue and a verdict at the bar; but ſtill theſe two things remain unqueſtionably true.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:172970:67"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the greateſt part of the Divine's buſineſs is preventive, and the greateſt task of Council learned in the law, is converſant not ſo much in the prevention of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies as in their final iſſue and determination.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That as we prevent quarrels, ſo we reconcile them too after another manner than the Lawyers do, we perſuade to peace among our ſelves and to obedience to the governours that are ſet over us, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to infuſe ſuch peaceable and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſpoſitions into men, as ſhall not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevent or reconcile one quarrel, or be a means of producing this or that act of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but ſhall be a laſting principle of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſhall run through our lives, and in every particular inſtance that can be given, ſhall naturally diſpoſe us to act ſo, as is moſt friendly to one another, moſt dutifull with reſpect to our ſuperiours, and in both caſes moſt for our own inward peace and reſt, for the quiet of the world and the happineſs of mankind.</p>
                     <p>The Divine reconciles one quarrel ſo as by that principle upon which the reconciliation proceeds to prevent another: The Lawyer prevents a quarrel ſo as to make men unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb facs="tcp:172970:68"/> under the reſtraint, and reconciles a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference after ſuch a manner as to leave the embers of a laſting animoſity, and the ſeeds of a contentious, diſcontented ſpirit raked up and glowing under the aſhes of the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The Divine ſaith, doe this and you ſhall be happy, doe it, or we cannot help your being miſerable, for there are natural trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and inconveniences annext to all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and unjuſt actions; there is an almighty arm which you cannot reſiſt that is over you, and there is a vengeance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects you in the world to come which it is in vain for you to think of eſcaping upon any other condition than that of repentance and amendment.</p>
                     <p>The Law ſaith, doe this or you ſhall be ſeverely puniſhed; the law promiſes nothing, neither indeed can it, for the rewards of vertue are natural and owing to the actions themſelves, therefore if the action will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it ſelf it may, but the law gives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but impunity to obedience, and to diſobedience propoſes terrour.</p>
                     <p>And after all, its ſanctions, which are founded in fear, are not onely leſs perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
<pb facs="tcp:172970:68"/> becauſe there is no argument to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade to obedience to a poſitive law but fear; becauſe there is nothing to be got by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion but impunity, or if any good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence follow from it, it is no thanks to the law but to the nature of the action; whereas the Divine who proceeds upon the nature and tendency of actions, does not onely work upon the fears of men, but likewiſe upon their hopes and their deſires, but he hath alſo this advantage that the terrours which the law diſplays, are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as belong to <hi>ouvert</hi> actions after due proof and proceſs hath been made, ſo that in many caſes there may be an hope of eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, nay, a moral impoſſibility that a man ſhould be diſcovered, and ſo the inclination to evil remains, being cheriſhed by an hope of impunity and concealment, and although the outward act be in many particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances reſtrained, yet the inward principle of the mind is not altered all this while, which cannot be done by any menace of the law, but by ſhewing men, whether they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered or not, that vertue and obedience are always for their intereſt whenever they will conſider all things impartially together.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:172970:69"/>
                     <p>And as the terrours of the law may be eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, which cannot be ſaid of thoſe of nature and religion, which are unalterable and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable, ſo alſo, as being but humane ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, they may in many caſes be reſiſted and overcome by men, and ſometimes they are laid aſleep by the connivence and partiality of men to one another; but in the rewards and puniſhments whether of natural or divine laws, the caſe is clean otherwiſe, for ſo far as they proceed from the natural iſſues and tendencies of actions, they have as neceſſary a dependence upon their emanative cauſe, as the light hath upon the ſun, or the ſtream upon the fountain, or heat and warmth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a quantity of combuſtible matter already kindled and in an actual flame, ſo that the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or actions themſelves being ſuppoſed, there is no way to avoid the natural effects that are conſequent upon them; the rewards are certain, the puniſhments inevitable: ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue cannot be ſeparated from the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are linked to it by a neceſſity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor wickedneſs be practiſed without the natural inconveniences that do by plain and phyſical cauſalities attend all its motions and follow it by a line of puniſhment, and
<pb facs="tcp:172970:69"/> a winding clue of guilt, which runs all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long parallel to that of ſin, into all its moſt ſecret laby rinths and retirements.</p>
                     <p>Again as thoſe rewards and puniſhments that are future and eternal are therefore the moſt inviting on the one hand and the moſt dreadfull on the other, becauſe of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity and everlaſting duration, ſo is the delightfull proſpect and aſſurance of the one rendred ſo much the more certain, and by conſequence more amiable and lovely to us, by a reflexion upon the veracity and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that being, who to the natural argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon which the belief of a bleſſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality depends, hath added the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and expreſs ratification of his written word, and the terrour of the other is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſtill more formidable and more awfull to us, by reflecting upon that juſtice which cannot be bribed, that power which cannot be reſiſted, and that knowledge to which all things are naked and expoſed, compared with the provocation which our ſins have given him to ſtretch forth his mighty arm and inflict all his vengeance upon us.</p>
                     <p>But yet I know not how it comes to paſs, there is a charm in the denunciation of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:172970:70"/> as well as in the promiſes of happineſs and reward, and thoſe calamities, which, being conditional and avoidable, cannot be avoided or reſiſted upon the breach of that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon which their avoidance or <hi>averrunca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> depends, have a certain eloquence to perſuade and pleaſe, as well as a diſmal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion to ſtartle and diſcompoſe us; and theſe two ſtates of happineſs and miſery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet in oppoſition to, or interwoven skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with one another, are like the well tempered lights and ſhades of an exquiſite maſter in the art of painting, and afford a mutual advantage to each other, they are like the diſcords in muſick happily met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to compoſe a melody of charming ſounds, like the jarring elements by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power and wiſedom reduced into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick unity of the world, and upon the whole matter, there is as much difference betwixt the dry terrour of an humane law, and the inſinuating charms, the ſoft and melting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuation of the natural and divine, as there is betwixt the violence of ſaws and chiſels, the ſcreaking of a cart or carriage-wheel upon its loaded axis, with the unnatural force of pulleys and of cranes to compell the ſtones
<pb facs="tcp:172970:70"/> and timber into a fitneſs and harmony with each other for the erecting of ſome ſtately building, and the prevailing harp of <hi>Orpheus</hi> or <hi>Amphion,</hi> by which they are perſuaded to come of their own accord and place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a beautifull and proportionable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; betwixt the notes of <hi>Arion</hi> and the noiſe of thunder, by one of which the <hi>Dolphins</hi> are affrighted, and to the other they dance.</p>
                     <p>Not that I would be thought to inſinuate in the leaſt, as if the reſtraints of humane laws were not of abſolute neceſſity in every commonwealth, nay they are indeed ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that there can be no ſociety without them, for what is an humane ſociety, but a ſociety governed by humane laws? and it is but too notorious by every days wofull experience, that all the reſtraints that can be laid upon men, whether they be natural, divine or humane, are little enough, nay they are too little, to conquer our frailties to ſubdue our appetites, and to withſtand our temptations; but yet it is ſtill manifeſt that thoſe arguments are more ſtrong, and conſequently thoſe perſons more uſefull in every Kingdom or ſtate, whoſe buſineſs it is, to create an inward principle of duty
<pb facs="tcp:172970:71"/> and obedience, than thoſe which onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the outward act but have no influence upon the mind and will, one of which is the caſe of natural and divine laws and the other of the humane, which by not being able to puniſh any thing but the outward act, do in a manner give a licence, if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to be conſidered, to all the ſecret and conceal'd iniquity that can poſſibly be committed.</p>
                     <p>To which it is to be added, that the hopes of pardon, the prevalence of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, the importunity of friends, and, which is more, of money, the conſideration of our common frailty, and the mutual pity and connivence of men that have offended or may offend towards one another, are things that do extremely rebate the edge of humane puniſhments, and by conſequence, by allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and qualifying thoſe fears which are the onely motives to obedience to any humane law, they are a proportionable temptation, or at leaſt they give ſtrength and power to thoſe temptations which prompt us to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and diſobey; and laſtly, when an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull fact is never ſo evidently proved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, yet there are three things that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:172970:71"/> caſes do either mitigate the puniſhment or utterly remove it. Firſt, That though a fact be never ſo wilfully committed, yet either by the favour of chance, or by the deſign and contrivance of the offender or by the art and eloquence of a ſubtile advocate it is capable of extenuating and alleviating cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in the appearance of the world. Secondly, That though a law be never ſo carefully drawn up by wiſe and skilfull men, yet there may oftentimes evaſions be found out to elude its force, and fruſtrate its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. And, Thirdly, That in commiſeration of a man's family and of the innocence of thoſe that are to ſuffer together with him, there ſhall be mercy ſhewn for the ſake of others though not for that of the offender himſelf.</p>
                     <p>But now the laws of nature are plain, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, inflexible, inexorable, their ſanction is founded in ſuch goods or evils as flow im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the nature and tendency of ſuch actions or ſuch habits conſidered in themſelves, and by conſequence they are ſuch as cannot be avoided, but the puniſhment will for ever bear a proportion to the guilt, and the rewards of innocence and vertue will always be proportionable to the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:172970:72"/> and then as for the divine laws, the <hi>terrour of the Lord,</hi> by which we endeavour to <hi>perſuade men,</hi> can no otherwiſe be avoided but upon the condition of an hearty and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere repentance joyned to an effectual and thorough reformation, or at leaſt a ſteady purpoſe of it, if God ſhould be pleaſed to grant us a longer life; and this laſt, generally ſpeaking, will not doe neither, becauſe a death-bed repentance at the cloſe of a wicked life, lays no manner of congruity upon the divine goodneſs, neither does it come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the termes of the covenant, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us with his bloud; and if a general pardon ſhould be allowed to be granted to all that do heartily repent when they come to die, this would be a thing of very bad example, and every man ſo long as he found any appetite within him, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temptation to be complied with from without, would naturally defer his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance till that time, and therefore it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt and reaſonable to ſuppoſe that God generally proceeds with men by other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and, to be ſure, to ſin on upon that ſuppoſition, that God will pardon us at the laſt caſt, is in it ſelf ſo bold a ſin, ſo intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb facs="tcp:172970:72"/> a preſumption, ſo great a provocation, that ſetting aſide thoſe ſins which are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon it, this alone would be enough to ſink us into the bottomleſs pit, from whence there is no poſſible redemption to be expected.</p>
                     <p>It being therefore ſo clear of what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and uſefulneſs the Clergy or Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in all nations is, to the creating in men a peaceable diſpoſition, a vertuous and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient temper of mind, for the happineſs of all and of every particular perſon, it muſt be granted likewiſe that it is moreover ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that all humane care and proviſion ſhould be made that they may not fall out or ſquabble among themſelves, either about matters of diſcipline or doctrine, becauſe this will leſſen their authority, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their uſe and ſervice among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the queſtion therefore is, to whom it is beſt that the exerciſe of this diſcipline ſhould be committed, whether to a Lay Judge, or an Eccleſiaſtical, and I anſwer, as I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered already, that it is beſt this juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be intruſted with the latter of theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men do more eaſily obey their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours in their own order, beſides that the
<pb facs="tcp:172970:73"/> juriſdiction being placed in Lay hands the Clergy have no proſpect, but of perpetual ſubjection, without ever hoping to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours themſelves, and this damps their ſpirits and diminiſhes their authority, and chokes that honeſt and laudable ambition, which is at once a cauſe of wiſdom and vertue in themſelves, and of obedience to thoſe that are in authority over them.</p>
                     <p>But then ſecondly, a ſecond reaſon why it is undoubtedly beſt for the Clergy to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Superiours of their own Order, is that as the perſons to be governed do more eaſily obey them, ſo thoſe that are to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern when they are of the ſame order, and have lived formerly in the ſame condition and circumſtances of life with thoſe that are to obey, have the greater ſenſe of what is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and juſt to be expected from them; they will not in probability behave themſelves like rigid taskmaſters, but equitable ſupervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, and are the more likely in all their conſtitutions and in all their cenſures to put themſelves into the place of their dependents, and to conſider that as being their own caſe again, which hath been ſo once already; they have ſomething in them which is very like
<pb facs="tcp:172970:73"/> that which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or <hi>natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> to the perſons of thoſe over whom they are placed, and for the honour and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the profeſſion, and the others in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal do <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, they expreſs their reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Paternal tenderneſs and love by ſuch an obedience, reverence and profound reſpect as becomes thoſe who have the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sons, in that which the <hi>Canon Law</hi> calls, though in another ſenſe, the <hi>Spiritual cognation;</hi> and certainly ſo much care on both ſides, on the one not to enjoyn any thing but what is reaſonable and fit to be done, what is for the intereſt of the obeiſant parties and of that of the profeſſion, and on the other not to diſobey any thing that is ſo, muſt needs make very much for the Honour and Reputation of the Clergy, and if ſuch an Order of men be of any uſe, for the ſervice of the world.</p>
                     <p>To which two conſiderations there is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a third to be added, which though in it ſelf very obvious I did not think of before, and that is that Clergy men, that is, men that both by their Education and Profeſſion have devoted themſelves to the ſervice of the Church, are certainly the beſt and the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:172970:74"/> proper Judges of Eccleſiaſtical whether things or perſons, and by the ſame reaſon that all the civil Guilds or Fraternities in a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have Maſters and Aſſiſtants out of their own number, to whom the chief conduct and adminiſtration of the affairs of ſuch a Society does belong; by the ſame reaſon that in a Parliament, a Committee for Trade ſhall call in Tradeſmen and Artificers to their aſſiſtance to take their opinions in the matters under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, of which they are naturally ſuppoſed to be the moſt competent Judges; by the ſame reaſon, that a Lawyer inveſted with the power and Character of a Judge ſits to hear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine controverſies upon the Bench, not a Muſician, an Aſtronomer, a Grammarian, a Chymiſt, an Architect, a Divine, or at leaſt not becauſe of any of theſe endowments or qualifications with which he may be over and above adorned, but becauſe of his skill and ability in the profeſſion of the Law; by the ſame reaſon certainly and upon the ſame Maxim, becauſe <hi>credendum eſt artifici in ſua arte,</hi> a Clergy man muſt needs be the moſt proper Judge in matters that are of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical cognizance and concern, if we will but grant this eaſie ſuppoſition that Divinity
<pb facs="tcp:172970:74"/> is more than an empty name, and that it does require a proportion of pains and ſtudy as well as other profeſſions do.</p>
                     <p>There are three Powers or Offices in every Eccleſiaſtical Society the full exerciſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of which does without all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on naturally and rightfully devolve upon the Clergy, and not upon all the Clergy neither, but onely upon the Governours or Biſhops of it.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is the power of Ordination.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond of Viſitation or inſpection, from whence they have the name of Biſhops or Overſeers.</p>
                     <p>And the third of Excommunication.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, it would be impoſſible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent innumerable Hereſies and Schiſms in the Church, if every Presbyter had the full power of Ordination in his hands, but it ought to ſatisfie the Presbyter in this caſe that he is not totally excluded, but that he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in as an aſſiſtant to the Biſhop, and that the Ordination is performed according to the genuine practice of antiquity by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, as well as
<pb facs="tcp:172970:75"/> by that of the Ordaining Biſhop himſelf. For the third, if every paſſionate Clergy man out of private ends or out of a raſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable temper might Excommunicate and devote upon every light occaſion, it would at once bring the Eccleſiaſtical cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to contempt, and be a means of infinite miſchiefs and confuſions in the Church. And for the ſecond it depends upon the firſt, for as they ſay in Law, <hi>ejuſdem eſt condere &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretari,</hi> ſo by the ſame reaſon, the power of Viſitation or inſpection muſt be ſeated in the ſame hands in which the Ordination is placed, the deſign and intent of it being onely this, to examine whether every reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Curate or Incumbent do anſwer the end and meaning of his Ordination.</p>
                     <p>And for the more authoritative and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual adminiſtration of ſo great a charge, it is requiſite that the Port and Dignity of the Biſhop above the inferiour Clergy may hold a proportion to his rank and ſtation; and it is in vain in this caſe to urge the poverty of the firſt Apoſtles and Preachers of Chriſtianity, who ſupplied by Miracles and ſupernatural inflictions, what they wanted of the natural cauſes of Authority and greatneſs among
<pb facs="tcp:172970:75"/> men, not that I would be thought to plead for ſuch an exceſſive Pomp, as hath more of pride and vanity than real uſe, but as it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to the ends of every well regulated Clergy, that their condition in the general ſhould be according to the admirable Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi>'s wiſh,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Too low for Envy, for Contempt too high.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So to anſwer the meaning of his inſtitution, it is neceſſary there ſhould be a proportion of grandeur in the Biſhop, ſuitable to the weight and dignity of his charge, and to the eminence of his place and order in the Church.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude this matter, with obſerving that Princes in all ages, who certainly may be thought to underſtand Government as well as ever a buſie Lay-elder of them all, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought it ſafeſt for the quiet of their Dominions to govern by Biſhops, and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to any one of common underſtanding, ſuppoſing the Roman Empire to be ſtill as great and flouriſhing as it was of old, whether the unity of ſo great a Body, would be more likely to be preſerved, by the government of Presbyteries pecking at one another and every moment in danger of crumbling into pieces, or by the Epiſcopal ſubordination, which
<pb facs="tcp:172970:76"/> makes the Church of God like a fair, firm and well compacted building whoſe parts do all give beauty and ſtrength to one another; and I do farther put the caſe, if we ſuppoſe all Chriſtendom at this day to be governed by Presbyteries after the new-fangled Republican Model, and having ſo potent a Monarch as the Turkiſh Sultan for their neighbour, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its ſtrength, however broken and diſuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, would be ſo firm and ſo well united as it is at this day to make head againſt him, or ſo likely to hold out againſt the terrours or temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Aſiatick ſteel or gold. Theſe things are eaſie to be conſidered and compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any man of ſenſe and experience in the world, and are, if I am not very much miſtaken, a plain and unanſwerable demonſtration on the Epiſcopal ſide, for certainly that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is the beſt calculated for the peace of the World, is alſo the moſt agreeable to the Goſpel of Chriſt, that Government which is the moſt likely and proper to defend Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, does beſt anſwer the ends of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
                     <p>Not but that in the Epiſcopacy as in all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments there may be inconveniences too, becauſe men are men and always will be men
<pb facs="tcp:172970:76"/> as long as the world endures, but it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient if it labour under fewer diſadvantages than the Presbytery does, or if it be the beſt Government that can be thought of to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the paſſions and deſigns of men from putting the world in a perpetual flame.</p>
                     <p>There have been feuds and animoſities in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time among the Biſhops, but that is not the queſtion, but onely whether they would not have been greater and more frequent in proportion to their number in a National or Provincial Synod of the Presbyters, as there are diſturbances ſometimes in a Parliament houſe, but does it follow therefore that to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thoſe inconveniences the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould meet together in a general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to make Laws, or would not the dangers and inconveniences be incomparably greater on this ſide than on the other? Or may I not now fairly ſum up the evidence in the words of that great Presbyterian St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue <hi>ad Luciferianos, Eccleſiae ſalus in ſummi Sacerdotis dignitate pendet, cui ſi non exors &amp; ab omnibus eminens detur poteſtas, tot in Eccleſiis efficientur ſchiſmata, quot Sacerdotes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It remains ſtill that, as I promiſed, I ſhould give ſome account why I have appeared ſo
<pb facs="tcp:172970:77"/> zealous for the execution of the Laws againſt Diſſenters, but the reaſonableneſs of that is now ſufficiently ſeen by the happy ſucceſs it hath had upon the affairs of a diſtracted King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſo that my anſwer is already made to my hands, and I have nothing to add, but my Prayers to God that the ſame Juſtice and Vigour may continue, and my moſt humble Petition to your Lordſhip, that you would pardon the preſumption of this long addreſs, for the ſake of its honeſt and well-meant inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from, My Lord,</p>

                  <p>But, if you will allow me that liberty which every man now pretends to as his birthright, that is, to ſpend my private opinion about the publick Concerns, I will put you in a way by which this bleſſed Union can onely be effected, and that is, by keeping up ſtrictly to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church, and by <hi>doing all things decently, and in order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have, almoſt every day, many excellent Diſcourſes delivered in the Pulpit, to perſuade us to mutual Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Forbearance with one another; and indeed this is in a manner the whole deſign of Chriſtianity, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in us thoſe calm and peaceable diſpoſitions of mind
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:172970:78"/> which are beſt fitted to make us happy in this life, and to prepare us for the bleſſedneſs of that other ſtate, whoſe very nature conſiſts in perfect Charity and perfect Peace. Wherefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us plainly, that without <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which is the very bond of Peace, and of all vertues, all our pretences to Religion, and all our attainments in it, our proficiencie in ſpiritual knowledge, and our ſuper-errogation, if that were poſſible in good works, will ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie juſt nothing at all; <hi>though I ſpeak with the tongue of men and Angels,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and have not charity, I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as ſounding braſs, or a tinckling Cymbal; and though I have the gift of prophecie, and underſtand all myſteries and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, ſo that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> nay, <hi>though I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> And if to the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of St. <hi>Paul</hi> you will add the greater Authority of our Saviour himſelf, he makes reciprocal Charity and Love to be the diſtinguiſhing mark and character of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye love one another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If therefore this Charity which is ſo eſſential to a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he cannot be ſo without it; if the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the ſpirit in the bond of peace</hi> can be preſerved under differing denominations of different Sects and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, notwithſtanding the different external forms and circumſtances of Divine Worſhip; if all or any of thoſe pious and learned Exhortations, which have been made to perſuade you to this Chriſtian temper, can have that good effect which is intended by them, notwithſtanding the various forms of Church Government, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of all other outward appendages and ceremonies of publick Worſhip; if we can <hi>fear God,</hi> and <hi>honour the King,</hi> and <hi>love one another,</hi> as well and as heartily in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172970:78"/> midſt of theſe differences, as if there were no ſuch things to be found among us, then, by my conſent, let all the Eccleſiaſtical Encloſures be laid open, and let every man worſhip God, ſo he do but worſhip him <hi>in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> and believe aright as to the fundamental Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, according to his own particular humour and fancie; becauſe by gratifying ſuch an harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, though unaccountable humour, there can no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience follow, but by diſturbing and croſſing it there may; and therefore the ends of Religion will be better ſerved by a diverſity in Worſhip, than by an uniformity of it.</p>
                  <p>But now, on the contrary, if it ſhould prove true, as it will moſt certainly, if either Experience or Reaſon can be heard amongſt us, that the onely way to Unity and Peace is by an Uniformity of Diſcipline and Obedience. as to the external circumſtances of Divine Worſhip, then this great end, being ſo neceſſary as it is for the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us all that Happineſs which either this World or the next can afford us, will juſtifie all the neceſſary means that can be uſed in order to the obtaining it.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore Uniformity being neceſſary as a means to Peace, and yet being impracticable unleſs the Church be ſuppoſed to be inveſted with a Power of preſcribing the external modes and circumſtances of Obedience, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows plainly, that the Church is actually inveſted with ſuch a Power, and that all its members are bound to obey its Preſcriptions.</p>
                  <p>For the Topick of Experience, it is not without ſome unwillingneſs that I mention it, much leſs do I think it proper at this time and place to lay open the wounds of our late unhappy times, or preſent you with a mournfull Scene of thoſe Miſeries and Diſtractions which neither can nor ought to be remembred without Amazement and Horrour.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:172970:79"/> But if you will, every one of you, retire into your own thoughts, and ask your ſelves the queſtion, What it was that brought thoſe dreadfull Calamities upon us, that involved three flouriſhing and powerfull Kingdoms in Bloud, and Slaughter, and Confuſion, that made the <hi>Gods to dye like men, and fall like one of the Princes;</hi> while Slaves were ſet over us to be our Maſters, and Frogs were heard croaking in the Chambers of our Kings; then you your ſelves will anſwer for me, It was the tender Conſcience diſſolved into rebellious Pretences, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed Order and Government before it, and overflow'd all things with a reſiſtleſs Stream; it was a Cry againſt Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and Ceremonies and humane Inſtitutions; it was a Clamor for Liberty, againſt Will-worſhip and the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of men; it was a Spirit of Sedition, a Thirſt after Innovation, an inſatiable Humour of being diſſatisfied with all the wholeſome Eſtabliſhments of Unity and Peace; it was an Itch of new-modelling both Church and State; it was a Phariſaical Pretence to farther Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Purity and Holineſs; it was Diſcontent, and Jealouſie and godly Fear, lin'd with Hypocriſie and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, that reduced our Beauty and Order into Aſhes, that laid the magnificent and comely Fabricks of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church and Empire, the Amazement of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Envy of their neighbours, equal with the ground; and, inſtead of one firm and well-compacted Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, rais'd paper Tenements of crumbling Sects and Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which, inſtead of being able to ſupport themſelves, betray'd us in a manner into that Security which we now enjoy.</p>
                  <p>While we, forgetfull of thoſe Miſeries under which our Fathers and our ſelves have groan'd, unthankfull for thoſe Bleſſings which, under the ſhade and protection of a wiſe and happy Government we receive, ungratefull to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, who out of that <hi>Chaos</hi> of Confuſion has
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172970:79"/> rear'd this new world of Eſtabliſhment and Order, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd with the fatneſs of the Olive, and the ſweetneſs of the Figg-tree, and quarrelling with the friendly and ſociable Vine that cheareth God and Man, are calling again for the Bramble to reign over us, and for the Thornes and Briars to protect us; or like the Iſraelites in the Wilderneſs, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited with Miracles, with Manna, and with Quailes, with the dew of Heaven, and with the fatneſs of the Earth; with liberty and eaſe and plenty; we are looking back for Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very from our old Taskmaſters in the Land of <hi>Ham,</hi> and longing for the Garlick and the Onyons of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe an inſtance taken from our late Confuſions, may but exaſperate whenit ſhould convince. Let us avoid the mention of that Crying Guilt, for which this Land of our Nativity has wept in tears of Bloud, and ſhould for ever mourn in Sack-cloth, and humble her ſelf before the Lord in Aſhes; and let us trace the footſteps of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſearch the Records of the more innocent and early Ages.</p>
                  <p>What was the reaſon in the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Diſpenſation, why all the external niceties of divine Worſhip, in their Feaſts, and in their Sacrifices, and in their Luſtrations were ſo carefully adjuſted, by the particular deſignation and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God himſelf?</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, that moſt of thoſe Ceremonies were of a ſymbolicall nature, and were deſigned to ſhadow out unto the <hi>Jewes,</hi> either that purity, ſimplicity and innocence of mind which God expects from all his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers and ſervants; or elſe they were figurative and emblematicall Repreſentations of the life and death and ſufferings of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and of that more perfect Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation which was to be introduced into the World by him.</p>
                  <p>But yet notwithſtanding, it muſt not be deny'd, that there are many Ceremonies to be found in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:172970:80"/> which being equally commanded by God himſelf, were of equall obligation as to their performance, with any of the reſt, of which no ſuch Typicall account can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And therefore the reaſon of their Inſtitution can only be this, That ſince every thing muſt of neceſſity be done with ſome Ceremony, in ſome Place, or Time, or Order, or Geſture, or Manner and Circumſtance, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it pleaſed God for the avoiding of Confuſion, and for the preſervation of an uniform and orderly way of Worſhip, which would otherwiſe be expoſed to perpetual change, diſturbance and alteration, to adjuſt and determine the particular circumſtances of thoſe indifferent matters, becauſe conſidering the perverſeneſs of ſome mens minds, and the diverſity of their ſeveral fancies and humours, ſuch changes and alterations could never happen without a conſiderable breach of Charity and Friendſhip among men; which muſt needs be a wonderfull Obſtruction as well to the intereſt of the Civil State, as to all the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Performances and Duties, both as to their devotion in themſelves, and as to their acceptance with Almighty God.</p>
                  <p>If therefore the nature of Mankind, be ſtill the ſame under the Goſpel that it was under the Law; if the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the neceſſity of Uniformity be the ſame now that ever they were in former ages; if the method of this Uniformity be not adjuſted by God himſelf under the Goſpel, as it was under the Law; and if this Uniformity cannot be obtained unleſs the Church be inveſted with a right and power of preſcribing the terms of it; than it follows plainly, as hath been already obſerved, that the Church muſt be inveſted with ſuch a power, becauſe elſe it would want the neceſſary means of its own unity and preſervation, which every Society muſt be ſuppoſed by the Laws of nature and reaſon, to be inveſted with; and if the Church be inveſted with ſuch a power, then all its Members are under an indiſpenſable obligation to obey
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:172970:80"/> it, becauſe that Power which may be lawfully diſobey'd, is no Power at all: And this is ſufficient to vindicate the exerciſe of Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures.</p>
                  <p>And if you demand further, Whether it be lawfull for the civil Sanction to interpoſe in behalf of the Church, to ſee that its Orders and Injunctions be duly and faithfully executed and obey'd, I anſwer that it is for this plain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe the Civil Power has a right of exacting all kinds of lawfull Obedience from its ſubjects; and this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience if it were not Lawfull, could not be enjoyned by the Church it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But beſides the expreſs proviſions of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> it ſelf, there were alſo ſeveral pretended traditions of <hi>Moſes</hi> from Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> there were likewiſe the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of their Wiſe men in controverted caſes; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of the <hi>Tannaim</hi> and the <hi>Amoraim;</hi> and of the Schools of <hi>Hillel</hi> and of <hi>Schammai,</hi> the two ſo much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, but diſagreeing Founders of the <hi>Phariſaick</hi> Order. For which Traditions and Determinations of their famous Maſters, the <hi>Jewes</hi> had uſually as great if not greater Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration than for the Law it ſelf; and they were at length ſwell'd into ſo vaſt a bulk, that (like the Miſſals and the Rituals of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church at this day, which are ſo full of Ceremonies, burthenſom in their number, frivolous and ſuperſtitious in their uſe) they ate out the very life and heart of true Religion; as our <hi>Saviour</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſeveral places of his Goſpel with no leſs Juſtice than ſeverity complains.</p>
                  <p>The Heathen World had alſo their Sacred Offices preſcribed by a certain Form as well before as under the Law: And the ſame is the caſe with the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolaters at this day; which Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of theirs, though for their number they be intoller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a devout Soul, which cannot ſuffer it's ſelf to be ſo far taken off from the more inward and ſubſtantial
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:172970:81"/> part of Religion, though in their nature they be moſtly foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and in their uſe Superſtitious, and in their deſign Idolatrous, as being directed to a falſe object; yet as well theſe as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Formalities do prove thus much by the common conſent of Mankind, that an Uniformity in the outward circumſtances of Divine Service, is neceſſary to the more due and ſolemn performance of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to the publique peace and quiet of the World.</p>
                  <p>What is the reaſon that at this day the <hi>French</hi> Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the reformed Religion and its Profeſſors, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with ſo much violence and fury, thorough all the ſpatious Territories and Dominions of that mighty Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch? Shall we think it is a Zeal for the Catholique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as they are pleaſed to call it, that is for a Fardle of abſur'd, ridiculous and blaſphemous Superſtitions, that inſpires ſo wiſe and powerfull a Prince, with ſo mean thoughts of Cruelty and Revenge? Shall we think he acts upon a principle of Conſcience, who has ſufficiently diſcover'd to the world by his inſatiable thirſt after Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which cannot be purchas'd without the price of Bloud, that he has no other principle of action than that of a boundleſs appetite of Rule and Greatneſs? Shall he be thought to act upon a principle of Duty and Religion, who makes deſtructive and depopulating Wars without giving a reaſon, and violates the faith of Peace by arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Dependances and unwarrantable Claimes? Who conquers more by the peremptory Decrees of his late erected Chambers, than by the conduct of his Generals, or by the numbers, diſcipline and valour of his Armies?</p>
                  <p>What therefore can be the true cauſe and motive, why he that glories in the bleſſed title of the Moſt Chriſtian King, ſhould yet notwithſtanding, perſecute Chriſtianity it ſelf? What elſe can be the true reaſon of all this Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſeeming Madneſs, but that he wiſely conſiders that the true way to Empire abroad, is by unity and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:172970:81"/> peace at home, <hi>that a Kingdome divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand;</hi> and that theſe differences of Religion, as they have done already in the experience of that Kingdome as well as ours, will ſome time or other prove the occaſions of great diſorders and commotions in the State?</p>
                  <p>And ſhall we not then make uſe of the ſame wiſdome for the ſupport of Chriſtianity, which is with ſo much diligence and zeal made uſe of by others for its Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? For Popery is either no Chriſtianity at all, or it is Chriſtianity wrapt up and hid in ſuch an heap of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Superſtitions, that it can hardly be diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>Is it worth our while to contend about Ceremonies when we are loſing the Subſtance? to ſquabble and fall out about indifferent things, when our Religion and our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, our temporall and eternall Intereſt lye at ſtake? If the things preſcribed be indifferent and conſequently law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, why do we not ſhow that they are ſo by complying with them? If the quarrells raiſed about indifferent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, do yet notwithſtanding riſe as high, as thoſe which are agitated between the Papiſts and us about matters of a neceſſary and unalterable nature; why do we not ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and compoſe theſe unhappy breaches, by adding Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility to Obedience, and by <hi>ſubmitting to every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man,</hi> ſo far as we may without any violation of the Laws of God or right reaſon?</p>
                  <p>All our publique feuds and animoſities are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in our Religious Diſputes, and if they were but once compoſed, we ſhould be an happy Nation. The King would be glorious, and his People ſecure. We ſhould be ſafe at home and formidable abroad. We ſhould be in a condition to ſuccor our Allyes, to relieve the diſtreſſed Proteſtants, to keep the ballance even betwixt our neighbour Princes, and to ſtop the progreſs of the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> which threaten to involve all <hi>Europe</hi> in Slavery and Superſtition together. Whereas now all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:172970:82"/> we are able to do, is to give protection for a while to perſecuted Religion when it flies hither for ſhelter.</p>
                  <p>But what will become of us, when the ſame torrent of Ambition, having overſlown what ever ſtood in its way, ſhall at length beat upon the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Shore? Shall we ſuffer our ſelves to be devoured by our own inteſtine Diviſions, when the Enemy from without is battering our Walls and throwing in his Bombes among us? or ſhall we not rather unite together for our common ſafety? and ſhall we not ſeverely repent that we did not ſooner do it before it was too late, that we did not take ſweet counſell together and go into the houſe of God as friends?</p>
                  <p>Certainly this one conſideration, if it were but pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully and frequently impreſs'd upon our minds, muſt needs have a wonderfull influence upon us, and muſt even fright men, and compell them by arguments both of fear and love, into a thorough Reconcilement with the beſt of Churches, before it be too late, as well out of a principle of Intereſt as Duty; for beſides the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this World, it ought to afford matter of very ſad reflexion to us, or at leaſt to ſo many of us, as have been active either in cauſing or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>omenting the Differences that are among us, that we muſt one day give a dreadfull account before the Judgment-ſeat of God, for a great part of that Bloud which has been ſpilt, and of thoſe Spoiles, Rapines and Depredations, which have been made by the ambition or injuſtice of our Neighbours. We muſt be accountable for the oppreſſion of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Brethren beyond the Seas; and for ought we know, if theſe deſtructive Animoſities be not ſoon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, for the removall of the Candleſtick from among our ſelves, and for the finall extirpation of the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jewes</hi> had their Ritual, and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> their Liturgies or ſet forms of Divine Service, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:172970:82"/> Chriſtianity, and the other long before Popery, were known in the World.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, As to the Jewiſh Ritual, which cannot be deny'd to have been a thing of humane Inſtitution, it was ſo little diſapproved by our Saviour, or rather ſo highly approved, that he has been obſerved by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf,</hi> and <hi>Camero,</hi> and <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> and other learned men, to have borrow'd moſt of thoſe expreſſions which he makes uſe of in the Inſtitution of the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Body and Bloud from thence; and that Hymn which after the Celebration of that bleſſed Feaſt, he and his Diſciples went out to ſing together on the Mount of Olives, was by <hi>Paulus Burgenſis</hi> a Converted <hi>Jew</hi> and a learned Biſhop of the Chriſtian Church, and out of him by <hi>Buxtorf, Druſius,</hi> and others, conjectured to be the ſame which the <hi>Jews</hi> are uſed to call the <hi>Hallel hagadol,</hi> being a Song of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, conſiſting of ſeveral Pſalms, and uſed to be ſung in conſort at the Feaſt of the Paſſover and other ſolemn occaſions.</p>
                  <p>And that God Almighty has actually approved thoſe indifferent circumſtances in Divine Worſhip which have not been of his own appointment, being either not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or no where commanded in Scripture, and in uſe long before the Law was delivered; I will here prove by two other Inſtances, which I the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mention, becauſe they are omitted by the learned and judicious Writer of the <hi>Libertas Eccleſiaſtica;</hi> and becauſe they are no where, that I know of, taken notice of to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſhall be taken from that paſſage in the Pſalms, <hi>Early in the morning will I direct my prayer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and will look up,</hi> in which words, the Pſalmiſt, addreſſing himſelf immediately to God Almighty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the Poſture in which he would poure out his Prayers before him, by looking up towards Heaven;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:172970:83"/> now, becauſe we cannot imagine he would have made this Vow of looking up to God in Prayer, if he thought it would have been diſpleaſing to him, and if, on the other hand, it can be proved that this was the general cuſtom of that Countrey in all their Prayers and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; then we have here an Inſtance of an indifferent Poſture in Prayer, which the general cuſtom of <hi>Judaea</hi> had by degrees brought into the authority and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Law, which yet was no where inſtituted by any Divine Command; but that this was the general practice is plain from the <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, who tax them upon this account with worſhipping the Clouds and the Hoſt of Heaven.

                     <hi>for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy ground:</hi> now though it is true that <hi>Moſes</hi> was bound upon the leaſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the Divine Pleaſure to obey it, yet this would have been no reaſon of his Obedience had there not been ſuch a cuſtome in the World before that time; which, not having the leaſt foot-ſtep of a Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, was probably owing meerly to humane inſtitution, but yet we ſee was approved by God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>This Cuſtome prevailed alſo under the Law; though in the Law it ſelf it be no where enjoyned, in all their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feaſts, as appears from this, that the <hi>Jews</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to eat the Paſſover with their ſhoes on; which would have been a needleſs Command, if in their other Feſtivals they had not uſed to put them off; which was therefore done, becauſe every meal among the <hi>Jews,</hi> but more eſpecially their ſolemn Feaſts, was in the nature of a Feaſt upon a Sacrifice, as I could prove more largely if it would not be a digreſſion; and therefore, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an act of religious Worſhip, they were uſed to put their ſhoes off, as the cuſtom of thoſe Countries was in like caſes.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon the <hi>Turks</hi> at this day do alwaies goe barefoot into their Moſchs: and it was a Precept of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> recorded by <hi>Iamblichus,</hi> in his Life, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>So that here we have two plain Inſtances of Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in matters of an indifferent nature approved by God, but commanded onely by men, for an immemorial cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome whoſe original or legiſlative ſanction cannot be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and perhaps it never had any, but crept in by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, is as much an humane Inſtitution as a poſſitive Command, of whoſe Author we can give never ſo clear an account, as the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> is every whit as much of humane inſtitution as the Statute; and thoſe Tenures which hold onely by Cuſtom or Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are to all intents and purpoſes as good as thoſe which have Deeds and Charters to produce.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, if Cuſtom may be comply'd with in theſe caſes, then ſo may any other humane Inſtitution, and if Cuſtom may not, then is it unlawfull for us to goe to our Devotions at thoſe times when our Neighbours and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men are uſed to frequent them, becauſe this is an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition upon our Liberty, which is not ty'd up either to place or time any more than to any other indifferent circumſtance of action.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:172970:84"/>
                  <p>But if the places and times of Divine Worſhip may be lawfully determined by the Authority of the Church, (and if they may not, then the Church has no power to ſee that God be worſhipped at all, for he muſt be worſhipped at ſome place or time or other,) then I ſee no reaſon why the ſame Authority may not equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to all other indifferent circumſtances of action.</p>
                  <p>As for the uſe of Liturgies and Set-forms of Prayer in the Chriſtian Church, there is nothing more plain than that, as far as we can trace Antiquity, they have been conſtantly uſed, ſeveral of the ancient Liturgies are at this day extant among us; and the Service both of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and our's, is in a great meaſure taken from thence: nay, ſo ancient and in ſuch conſtant uſe have they alwaies been in the Chriſtian Church, that we have unqueſtionable Inſtances of them: in the Apoſtolical times themſelves, as hath been learnedly obſerved by a <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> Lloyd, <hi>Biſhop of St.</hi> Aſaph.</note> Reverend Prelate of our own from <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> in his ſecond Apology, who calls the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Chriſtians in his time, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Common Prayers:</hi> and from <hi>Pliny,</hi> in an Epiſtle to <hi>Trajan,</hi> very often cited by Learned men in defence of the Chriſtians of the primitive times, who, being examined by him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Manners and Religion, <hi>affirmabant hanc fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe ſummam vel culpoe ſuoe vel erroris, quod eſſent ſoliti ſtato die ante lucem convenire: carménque Chriſto, quaſi Deo, dicere, ſécum invicem,</hi> &amp;c. The Learned Prelate, whom I have newly mentioned, underſtands this place of Verſes anſwering one another by turns, as we ſpeak the reading <hi>Pſalms;</hi> and I know not, ſaith he, how he cou'd better expreſs it. And indeed this muſt be allow'd to be a very proper, and a no leſs acute and ingenious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation; for the <hi>Pſalms</hi> themſelves were many of them nothing elſe but Hymns of Praiſe and Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving which were compoſed for the Service of the Temple,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:172970:85"/> and this ancient way of worſhipping God by Hymns, as well in the heathen World as among <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians, is evident from the Hymns of <hi>Homer, Orpheus, Callima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and others among the <hi>Greeks;</hi> from Hymns of a like nature to be met with in the Interludes of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Dramatick Poeſie, in the Odes of <hi>Horace,</hi> and in the Writings of <hi>Statius, Catullus,</hi> and others: And in alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this it is that the ſame <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaies, in a Complyment to <hi>Trajan, Animadverto etiam deos ipſos non tam accuratis adorantium precibus quàm innocentiâ &amp; ſanctitate loetari: gratiorémque exiſtimari qui delubris eorum puram caſtám<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que mentem quàm qui meditatum carnem intulerit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among the Chriſtians, to be ſure, the ſinging of Pſalms and Hymns in honour of God and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and for the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual benefit and edification of one another, was alwaies looked upon as a ſpecial Duty, and we have ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture which do not onely vouch and juſtifie, but alſo enjoyn this Practice.</p>
                  <p>If therefore Hymns and Pſalms, in which many are to bear their parts, cannot poſſibly be ſung but by a Form; if they muſt be compoſed before they can be ſung; if this be a true and proper exerciſe of Devotion and Divine Worſhip; if Praiſe and Thankſgiving be eſſential parts of Prayer, as is manifeſt from that Petition in our Saviour's own Form, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name;</hi> nay, if it be the moſt exalted and ſublime exerciſe of a devout mind; and if all this may be done, and in many caſes muſt be done by a Set-form; then, why may not the ſame be true of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Prayer? and, why may we not from hence conclude, that a Form of Prayer, as it is alwaies lawfull, ſo it is in ſome caſes neceſſary to be uſed? it is neceſſary, becauſe Pſalms and Hymns cannot be ſung without it; and it is neceſſary, becauſe in ſome caſes we are enjoyned to ſing Pſalms or Hymns by the expreſs command of Scripture.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:172970:85"/>
                  <p>And here, before I paſs by farther, let me ask our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Brethren one Queſtion, they in their Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are uſed to ſing together the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rhimes, ſome of them of one man's compoſing, and ſome of another; now, though the words of the Pſalms themſelves, eſpecially as they are in the original, were divinely inſpired, and therefore they may pretend, though it be a Form, yet it is not a Form of humane Inſtitution; yet the words of him that puts them into Meeter are not <hi>David's</hi> words, any more than a Paraphraſe and the Text are the ſame: the ſame ſenſe may be expreſſed in different words, and thoſe different words are ſo many different forms to them that reade them; from whence it is manifeſt that they do not pray by <hi>David's</hi> Form which was inſpired, but by the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's, which is of humane Inſtitution; and why then do they declaim ſo loudly againſt a Form of Prayer? Why they will tell us, the Scripture has no where enjoyned it; but I have proved the contrary, and they themſelves confute their own Pretences by their Practice.</p>
                  <p>But, ſuppoſe the Scripture did not enjoyn it, what then? if we muſt neither pray with a Form nor without, unleſs the Scripture bid us doe one or the other, then we muſt not pray at all; for the Scripture does not any where command either of theſe, unleſs it be in the uſe of the <hi>Lord's Prayer;</hi> and yet at the ſame time enjoyns us to <hi>pray without ceaſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe Gentlemen, if they were half ſo good Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers as they are bad Divines, would have underſtood before now, that all Prayer is a Form, and that without a Form it is impoſſible to pray at all: for the ſenſe at the bottom of all Prayer is the ſame; it is either a devout ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment and admiration of the Divine Excellence and Perfection, or it is a thankſgiving for his Mercies, or an humbling our ſelves before him for our Sins, or
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:172970:86"/> entring into new engagements and reſolutions of a new Life, by offering up the Sacrifice of a broken and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite Heart; or laſtly, it is a deprecating thoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which hang over our heads for our Sins, and an entreating his Goodneſs for thoſe Bleſſings which the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of our nature, or the circumſtances of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and condition do require; and let theſe things be expreſſed with never ſo much variation of phraſe, yet it is not that variation in which the true nature of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er conſiſts; but it is the ſenſe which is at the bottom, which is alwaies the ſame, as a tune is the ſame, though it be pricked down by never ſuch variety of marks, and a ſentence the ſame, expreſs'd by ſeveral cyphers.</p>
                  <p>It is not the words that God regards, but it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ardency and Devotion of the mind, which may be the ſame with a Form as without it; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, it may be greater with a Form than it can be without it, becauſe then he that officiates, not being to ſeek for what he is to ſay, and his fancie and invention, not being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually upon the rack, his mind is the more intent and fixt upon the Object of his Devotion, and upon a ſober and conſiderate reflexion upon thoſe things which make up the entire theme and ſubject of his Prayer: he is not apt to diſhonour God, nor to expoſe himſelf and Religion to contempt by raſh and inconſiderate expreſſions uttered in the heat of a diſtempered and inconſiderate Zeal, which we find by experience, I ſpeak without reflecting upon any particular perſon, many of our non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conforming Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren doe, as well in their Prayers as Sermons, for want of duly conſidering what they have to ſay before-hand, which ſhows plainly what extream Preſumption and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are guilty of, when they pretend to utter ſuch contemptible ſtuff by the aſſiſtence of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, there was in the firſt ages of the Church ſuch a thing as the Gift of utterance, but it was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:172970:86"/> when men of mean parts and education were ſent forth to preach the Goſpel by our Saviour himſelf, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this could not have delivered themſelves as became the Embaſſadors of ſo great a King; it was at a time when the World could not be converted without Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, when the Fears of Death and Torments and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution would have put all their natural faculties to ſilence, had they not been aſſiſted and encouraged by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary influence of Divine Grace from above: It was at a time when they were to be carry'd before Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Rulers, to give an account of themſelves and of that Goſpel which they preached; and then it was neceſſary indeed, that a particular aſſiſtence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit ſhould overpower the fears of death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all apprehenſions of danger out of their way, and that the words which they were to ſpeak ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them and put into their mouths at that very inſtant, leſt otherwiſe, for want of ability or courage, they ſhould expoſe and betray themſelves and the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>But at this time of day there is no neceſſity of any ſuch ſupernatural aſſiſtence; and that it is not actually afforded appears partly from the experience which we have of thoſe that pretend to it, and partly from this that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly tells us, that the Gift of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, of Tongues, and of Knowledge were in time to fail; and if they be not failed already, as well as thoſe other miraculous Powers of Healing Diſeaſes, and of Caſting out Devils, we have little or no reaſon to believe that ever they will; beſides, that the Gift of Tongues being manifeſtly ceaſed, and theſe three being mentioned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we have abundant reaſon to conclude, that thoſe of Prophecie and Knowledge are ceaſed together with it.</p>
                  <p>But after all, we have no Promiſe in Scripture, that God, though by his Spirit he will furniſh us with affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and zeal to the end of the World, will ever put the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:172970:87"/> very expreſſions into our mouths; the Spirit it ſelf <hi>hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth our infirmities,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry buſineſs of Prayer, but it is not with a Gift of utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but with Groans that cannot be uttered: let our words be what they will, ſo our hearts be but right, God is well pleaſed.</p>

                  <p>It is true indeed, ſuch is the nature of ſtyle, that the ſame ſenſe clothed in different expreſſions, ſhall either extort reſpect or laughter; the reaſon is, becauſe all ſpeech is either proper or metaphorical; in proper ſpeech, where the words are the real and immediate marks of the things they expreſs, there we are affected with the ſentence according to the opinion we have of thoſe things which are contained under it; but in metaphorical, we are differently affected, as the Metaphors are taken from things of a contemptible or a ſerious and uſefull na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Now nothing is more plain than that in religious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, whether in Prayer or Sermon, nothing ought to be ſaid after ſuch a manner as to move laughter or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt inſtead of exciting Devotion and ſerious attention; but whether this end be more likely to be attained by an extempore or well-conſidered and premeditated Prayer, let any man of common ſenſe and underſtanding judge.</p>
                  <p>And though ſuch raſh and inconſiderate expreſſions may be well enough approved where they are uttered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong people that are affected by noiſe rather than by ſober and judicious expreſſions, by a ſound and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Form of words, yet it ought to be conſidered, one would think, how unbecoming ſuch things are to the gravity of one that pretends to teach and inſtruct the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:172970:87"/> World, or to the Majeſty of that Perſon whoſe Character he ſuſtains; what ſcandal it gives to underſtanding men, and what advantages to the profane: and laſtly, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable it is to the deſign of Religion, which is to make men happy by creating in them a calm and ſedate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; not ſo much to move their Paſſions as to inform their Judgments, and to prepare them for Happineſs by wiſedom and inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>But if there be any who, by the ſtrength of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts, by the quickneſs of their fancie, or the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubility of their tongues, by long cuſtom, or acquired habits, by art and ſtudy, by ringing the changes and by ſhuffling the ſame expreſſions at ſeveral times into a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral order and method, ſhall from thence ſeem either to themſelves or others to be poſſeſſed of this Gift of Prayer, yet they are in truth and reallity very much miſtaken, and it will appear they are ſo, in that they generally uſe theſe, whether talents or acquirements, or artifices and devices of theirs, rather in a way of oſtentation than uſe, by ſpinning out their Devotions to an unuſual length, and by endeavouring to captivate the ears and hearts of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate people by that much ſpeaking which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour condemns.</p>
                  <p>Thus it appears plainly that a ſober and well-conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Form of Prayer is a manifeſt advantage both to the Speaker and the Hearer, and to the latter it is an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in a reſpect which I have not yet mentioned.</p>

                  <p>And the ſame Chapter will likewiſe furniſh us with another argument againſt theſe extempore Effuſions, when they are truly and properly, and not onely preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly ſo, which is but to put a cheat upon the People; namely, that they are ſubject either to the heats of Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm on the one hand, or to the coldneſs of Non plus and Drawling on the other; both of which expoſe Religion to contempt in the opinion, or at leaſt in the practice of thoſe whoſe deſign and intereſt it is to make it contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and cheap, and ſerves to alienate the affections of much wiſer men than ever they are like to gain over to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the whole Church be come together to ſpeak with Tongues, and there come in thoſe that are unlearned and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers, will they not ſay that ye are mad?</hi> and if the ſame or a like advantage may and will be taken from the indiſeretion of every extempore Pretender, there is the ſame reaſon why he ſhould lay by his pretences, and give way to a ſound and ſober Form of words.</p>

                  <p>If then the uſe of Forms of Prayer in the publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of Chriſtians be not onely lawfull in it ſelf, and juſtified by the practice of all ages before the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but alſo manifeſtly tending to Edification, and freed from very many and very great inconveniences to which extempore Addreſſes are expoſed, and therefore neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be allow'd.</p>
                  <p>And if though Forms of Prayer be neceſſary in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, yet this or that particular Form be not, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Liturgy of all Churches and all Ages muſt be exactly the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If no Formulary of Divine Service can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the common uſe and practice of the Church but by the publick Sanction, whether ſacred, or civil, or both, then we have here a plain inſtance of a lawfull humane Impoſition in indifferent matters; for though a Form of Prayer be neceſſary, yet this or that Form is not; from whence it follows, beyond all poſſibility of contradiction, that an humane Impoſition in indifferent matters, or a Determination of thoſe indifferent things by the authority of men to one part of the indifference is not in it ſelf unlawfull, and whatſoever may be lawfully commanded is of neceſſity to be obey'd, unleſs we will renounce all obedience whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>However, thus much will certainly be granted by the moſt avow'd Aſſertors of the Separation, that we have every one of us a right and power of determining our
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:172970:89"/> ſelves in thoſe indifferent matters; for otherwiſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their indifference is deſtroy'd; and yet if thus much be but allow'd, they will find themſelves driven to an abſolute neceſſity, either to contradict themſeves, and to affirm contradictions in a breath, to ſay that the ſame things are and are not indifferent at the ſame time, or elſe they muſt bid adiew to their beloved Cauſe, and give ſubmiſſion to the Authority of the Church.</p>
                  <p>For whatever natural Liberty men have in themſelves, when once they become members of a Society, they are ſuppoſed to give it up to the legiſlative or governing power of that Society ſo far as is neceſſary to the peace and quiet of it; for otherwiſe a Society and no Society would be exactly the ſame, that is, every man would ſtill remain his own Maſter, and at liberty to doe as much as ever he could before.</p>
                  <p>For example, in that which Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> is pleaſed to call the State of Nature, when a man is not a member of a Body politick, but a diſtinct and perfectly indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent perſon by himſelf, he is naturally inveſted with a right and power of defending his perſon or his poſſeſſion by force of Arms, he may lawfully revenge his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and he is the onely Judge when he is wronged or injur'd; becauſe without all this power he cannot live in the World, or continue in that Being which God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have given him.</p>
                  <p>But if having liſted themſelves by mutual covenant and agreement into a Body politick or Commonwealth, for the mutual defence and preſervation of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon and of the whole Society, men ſhall notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding after this aſſume the ſame liberty to themſelves of perſonal Revenges, and of being their own Judges in controverted caſes, without referring themſelves to the deciſion of the Law which is the civil Umpire betwixt man and man, it is manifeſt this Society cannot be of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:172970:89"/> long continuance, or rather ſo long as this Liberty is taken it can never be a Society properly ſo called; from whence it follows plainly, that it is neceſſary, if men will be members of a Society, that they give up this private power into the hands of the publick.</p>
                  <p>If therefore the Church be a Society truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called; if it be that myſtical Body of which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Head; if the members of this Body cannot be knit and well compacted together without external rules of diſcipline and order, in which the very nature of a Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety conſiſts; if the publick Orders of the Church and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man's preſcribing rules to himſelf be inconſiſtent together, and if the obſerving no rule or method at all either in Divine Worſhip or civil converſation be rather like a man in <hi>Bedlam</hi> than a Deniſon of a ſober Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; if charity, good-will and love; if mutual help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and reciprocal uſefulneſs to one another; if peace with God, and peace with men, and peace within our ſelves be the great deſign and buſineſs of the Chriſtian life; if a man cannot be at peace with God while he is at enmity with his neighbour; if a man can neither love, nor fear, nor know, nor worſhip God aright at the ſame time when his thoughts are taken up and filled with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, uncharitableneſs, detraction and revenge; if no man can be happy in himſelf when he is diſpleas'd and angry with other men; if the controverſies raiſed about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters confeſſedly indifferent have been, when and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have happened, a perpetual bane and diſquiet to the Church; if they alwaies heighten mens Paſſions againſt and alienate their affections from one another; if they are alwaies attended with a diſturbance of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace, and have <hi>de facto</hi> proceeded to the utter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion both of Church and State; if all theſe Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Contenſions would immediately ceaſe by a quiet and dutifull ſubmiſſion to the Authority of the Church;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:172970:90"/> if by giving up this Power, the Church, as a Body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or Society of men is actually diſſolved, a Society or Aggregate of ſeveral perſons, being no otherwiſe one. than as they ſubmit to the ſame Laws and are governed by the ſame external Rules of diſcipline and obedience; if Place and Time, notwithſtanding they be indifferent in themſelves as to this or that particular determination, yet is it neceſſary in the general that they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, otherwiſe there can be no publick Worſhip of God: laſtly, when men are met together in a religious Aſſembly; if every man ſhall follow his own particular fancie; if almoſt every ſingle perſon ſhall be ſeen in a different poſture; and if this be more like to make men look upon one another than to attend to the Miniſter or to mind themſelves; if it be more like to excite laughter than devotion; if it be a natural obſtruction to the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ſeriouſneſs of religious Worſhip; if, done by chance, it be a ſign of too great negligence and remiſneſs; and if, done on ſet purpoſe, it be a ſign of conceitedneſs and ſpiritual pride, while every man prefers his own way, and deſpiſes that of another; if it be a ground of cenſure, and may be a cauſe of uncharitableneſs, and, by degrees, of ſeparation; then is it plain, upon all theſe accounts which I have mentioned, becauſe it would be better if it were ſo, and becauſe it is neceſſary that it ſhould be ſo; becauſe the Church can neither preſerve it ſelf in reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor ſo much as in being, becauſe it is for its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted and its perpetual intereſt, and becauſe it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to its preſervation, that it ſhould be inveſted with an Authority of adjuſting the moſt indifferent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Divine Worſhip; without which the bleſſed ends of Unity and Peace can never be obtained: I ſay; it is plain from all this, that the Church is actually inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with this Power, and that Eccleſiaſtical Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may for the ſame reaſon determine indifferent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:172970:90"/> for which the Civil forbid Adultery and Murther, namely, becauſe it is neceſſary to the publick Peace; which reaſon, if it be not ſufficient, the Civil Laws do all of them become immediately null and void, as being founded upon no other baſis but the conſideration of the publick good; but if it be a ſolid and ſubſtantial reaſon, I would fain know, if any of the Diſſenters be at leiſure to inform me, why it may not equally extend to defend the neceſſity, and conſequently juſtice of Eccleſiaſtical whether Laws or Cenſures.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially if we conſider that, as the caſe of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world now ſtands, the ſame perſons, with the ſame intereſts, prejudices and paſſions are members both of the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical State; ſo that it is as impoſſible there ſhould be a diſturbance in the one, in which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall be unconcerned, as that the ſame man ſhould be divided from himſelf; and it is every whit as clear, that either it is not lawfull to uſe all neceſſary means for the preſervation of the Civil Peace, or it is lawfull for the Church to concern her ſelf in the determination of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different matters, which Determinations and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of hers may be lawfully confirmed and ratified by the State.</p>
                  <p>If men could differ without falling-out, ſomething might be pretended in behalf of an innocent, though unbecoming Liberty, but ſince the greateſt feuds and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoſities do ſometimes take their riſe from the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt beginnings, ſince the religious differences are of all others the greateſt, and the moſt fatal to the publick Peace, ſince there is nothing ſo infinitely ſcrupulous as an unreaſonably tender Conſcience, and ſince there is no pretence ſo inconſiderable, from whence either indigent or ambitious men will not take occaſions to advance their ſecular deſigns under the ſpecious covert of a Concern for Liberty, or a Zeal for Religion, it behoves thoſe in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:172970:91"/> Authority, as they tender the reputation of their own wiſedom and juſtice, or the quiet of the World, to cut off all occaſions of diſturbance, by ſeeing that <hi>all things be done decently and in order,</hi> which rule of the Apoſtle's is founded upon the ſame reaſon upon which all Laws whether humane or divine are founded, and from whence alone they can and do receive their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, the common Intereſt of mankind and the particular Happineſs of private perſons; it depends upon the ſame reaſon and the ſame neceſſity, for which Injuſtice and Robbery are forbidden, or upon which Induſtry, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and uſefull Arts are encouraged; which is nothing elſe but the conſideration of the publick Good, which if it be as plainly concerned in this as in any other caſe, this is ſufficient to defend the Authority of the Church, and to make its Sanctions in indifferent matters, ſo long as they are ſteered by principles of undoubted Intereſt, to be of perpetual force and obligation.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe actions are properly ſaid to be indifferent, which may either be done or let alone without inconvenience or advantage to the publick, or to the intereſt of any private perſon; but if any prejudice or advantage will accrue, then there is a plain reaſon why they ſhould be done or omitted, and conſequently they ceaſe to be in different, and become neceſſary in proportion to the weight of thoſe reaſons upon which their performance or omiſſion is founded.</p>
                  <p>So, for example, we will ſuppoſe it for the preſent indifferent in what poſture we ſay our Prayers in a pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lick Congregation; yet if we ſay them at all, thus much is of abſolute neceſſity; that we ſay them in ſome poſture or other; but now if the Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, for the avoiding of Confuſion, and for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of thoſe Piques and Animoſities which frequently happen among men about things of little or no value in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:172970:91"/> themſelves, eſpecially when Religion is concerned, ſhall ordain that all men ſhall ſay their Prayers in one and the ſame poſture, and ſhall determine and aſſign what that particular poſture ſhall be; then here is a reaſon of Intereſt for the good of the World, and for the quiet of that Society of which we are members, why this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ſhould be uſed rather than any other; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this poſture, though indifferent before, does now derive a neceſſity from that reaſon of State and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt upon which it's impoſition is founded.</p>
                  <p>To be ſure men of common ſenſe and underſtanding, if they have but common honeſty joyned together with it, will take their meaſures of obligation as to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or unlawfulneſs of what is commanded, from it's deſign and tendency to promote or obſtruct the intereſt of the Publique, and the happineſs of particular Perſons; and if either the pretended or the real Scruples of any might be ſufficient to ſtop the courſe of Law againſt the common intereſt, there could be no ſuch thing as Order or Government in the World.</p>
                  <p>There are many Laws enacted by the ſublime Wiſdome of the King and his three Eſtates in Parliament aſſembled, which though they be for the intereſt of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, all things conſidered; yet they manifeſtly tend to the Prejudice of particular perſons, but yet thoſe very perſons are as much obliged by theſe Laws, as they who reap the benefit and advantage of them, becauſe the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of theſe Laws is to be taken from the fundamentall Conſtitution of all Societies, that a greater Intereſt be preferred before a leſs, and that when the publique advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ſhall interfere with a private, the private muſt give place, becauſe otherwiſe the Society cannot be preſerved; how much more ſtrictly therefore are we obliged by thoſe Laws whoſe deſign and tendency being nothing elſe, but to keep us all at unity and peace together, are ſo
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:172970:92"/> plainly for the advantage of the Publique and of every particular Perſon?</p>
                  <p>And if notwithſtanding the manifeſt Conducibleneſs of ſuch an Uniform way of Worſhip to the publique Peace, and the experience of thoſe ſad Effects which our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Differences have produced, every private man ſhall yet after this take upon him to Judge of the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs or Expedience of what is Enacted by his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and ſhall from thence proceed upon I know not what Pretences, ridiculous in themſelves and deſtructive of the publique Wellfare, to withdraw his Obedience to their juſt Commands; he may as well take upon him an inſinite and boundleſs liberty of queſtioning the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs and Equity of all Laws whatſoever, and either upon the ſame or more warrantable Exceptions, for the expedience of no Law can be more evident than of that which enjoyns Uniformity in Divine Worſhip, he may withdraw his Obedience from all kind of Government and Subjection whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>But here it is Objected, That if there were nothing but the Civil Intereſt, or the Intereſt of this World to be conſidered, the experience of all Ages and Nations will ſufficiently demonſtrate, that an Uniformity in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matters, is the beſt Expedient that can be thought of to ſecure the publique Peace. But alaſs! we carry ſouls and Conſciences about us, and theſe are precious things; there is an immortal Intereſt lyes at ſtake, which it would be great folly and madneſs to part with upon any temporal conſideration.</p>
                  <p>But to this I anſwer firſt in the general, That the main deſign of Chriſtianity being to promote Peace and Charity in this world, as well as to procure us Eternal peace and happineſs in the next; and indeed the one in order to the other, it follows plainly that Uniformity in Religious Worſhip, as being a neceſſary means to Peace,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:172970:92"/> is in the general of Divine Inſtitution, though what the particular terms of that Uniformity ſhall be, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has no where preſcribed; as in truth it could not do, for a reaſon which I ſhall ſhew hereafter: it remains therefore, that the Church it ſelf be in all Ages furniſht with a right and power of preſcribing what thoſe terms ſhall be, and that all her members are obliged to a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Obſervance of them.</p>
                  <p>But here, becauſe I have made ſo frequent mention of the Church, that I may avoid Ambiguity, and leave as little room as may be for Exception, before I go any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will explain what I mean by that term, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſcending to too much nicety, the Church is one of theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is the congregation of Chriſtian People diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed over the whole earth, and agreeing together in the fundamental Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, which are either expreſly, or by direct and lawfull conſequence, revealed in the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, to be of neceſſity to Salvation. And in this ſenſe it is not only unneceſſary that there ſhould be every where the ſame Rites and Ceremonies obſerved in the Church, but it is in the nature of the thing impoſſible that there ſhould, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of neceſſity the ſeveral manners, cuſtomes, and other circumſtances of ſeveral Nations, will introduce a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of external Formalitie into Religious Worſhip, which may be done without any breach of Charity or Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip among men, becauſe there is no intereſt to be ſerved by promoting Feuds and Animoſities between them; and it will be all one to the peace and happineſs of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, what rites or uſages ſoever the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Armenian</hi> Churches ſhall embrace.</p>
                  <p>We do not much trouble our heads, though by reaſon of their near Neighbourhood we have ſome reaſon to do it, about the <hi>French</hi> ſaying Maſs, or adoring Reliques, or Images,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:172970:93"/> or praying for Dead, or worſhipping the Hoſt: Nay, you ſhall hardly ever ſee a man in a paſſion when he hears the Tragicall ſtories of thoſe horrible perſecutions againſt the profeſſours of the Reformed Religion; but though he may relieve and pity them, ſo far as a ſmall temporary Contribution will go, yet in truth and reality he is not much concerned; whereas at home we can make a ſhift to fall out about much ſmaller matters; the reaſon is, becauſe we are not embarked in the ſame bottom with them, and ſo being able to do neither good nor hurt by being angry or diſpleas'd, we ſcarce ever trouble our ſelves. But at home the pretences of Religion and Liberty, which are always ſtirring when ever there is any proſpect of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique Diſorders likely to enſue upon them, will never fail to excite the ambitious, the diſcontented, and the needy, to embroyle the State out of principles either of Intereſt or Revenge, while the paſſions of men that day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſe together, and are engaged by intereſt, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, or duty in the reſpective parties, do but ſerve to blow the cole, and improve the ſparks of Animoſity into a flame of War.</p>
                  <p>The conſequence of all which is, That there may be differences in the univerſal Church, conſiſting of many Kingdomes and Provinces without diſſention; and that all that whatever it is, which is requiſite to the <hi>unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace,</hi> may be conſiſtent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough with differences in ſmaller matters, but that in the ſame Kingdome or Dominion this can never be.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> By the Church we may underſtand a National Congregation of Chriſtian People, divided into many partitions or particular aſſemblies united together by an unity of Faith, and Diſcipline, and Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction; and this is that which I affirm to be neceſſary in every Kingdome or State that would avoid all occaſions of publique Tumults and Diſorders, and would be as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:172970:93"/> happy either as themſelves can wiſh, or as Chriſtianity deſigns to make them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore this is that unity which is by every Good Chriſtian, good Citizen, or good Subject, above all things which this world can afford, the moſt earneſtly to be deſired: for the obtaining of which, he is to ſubmit to every thing that ſhall be required of him, and he is to abſtain from every thing which is forbidden him; if all things conſidered, it may lawfully be done or avoided.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In compliance with thoſe of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall way, I am content to allow a third ſenſe of the word Church to be a particular and independent Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation governed by Laws and meaſures of its own, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging no Juriſdiction Forreign to it ſelf; and this is a Form of Church Government, which in a Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome or Common-wealth, I affirm to be naturally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull: And here there are two caſes to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Either the whole body of the People is divided into ſuch particular and independent Congregations, or there is a nationall Eſtabliſhment from which theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregations have ſeparated themſelves. The firſt of theſe is <hi>Babel in Effigie,</hi> the very Emblem and Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip of Confuſion, ſubject to inconveniences that cannot be thought of till they are felt, and capable of ſuch infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſub-diviſions as will at length reduce the comely Form of Government by ſo many particular intereſts and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into a State of publick Hoſtility and Rapine; for the reaſon why men ſeparate from one another, is always out of ſome reall or ſome pretended diſlike, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes by actuall ſeparation, are ſo far from being compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that they are manifeſtly improved and heightned by it; and from hence ariſe ſo many ſeveral Intereſts as there are Sects or denominations of Parties in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                  <p>For it is natural to all men to deſire to gain Proſelytes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:172970:94"/> to their own Opinion, for men to love themſelves and thoſe of their own way, and to think of other men, who are not enroll'd in the ſame liſt with themſelves, if not with a reall hatred, yet with a leſs eſteem and a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Averſation, which whenever a Ball of Intereſt is thrown between them, will be improved into all the ſad effects of the moſt deſperate Malice and Revenge.</p>
                  <p>But here to make all ſure as I go along, I muſt repeat again, That by Ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>endent Congregations, I mean, ſuch as own no Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction externall to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; from whence it is eaſie to perceive that every ſuch Congregation may be a new Sect and Party by it ſelf; as it was in a manner in the late Times, when the Sects were ſpawned in ſuch increadible abundance, that the Alphabet began to complain of want of Letters to furniſh ſo many different and diſagreeing Parties with names.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it to be ſuppoſed that ſo many ſeveral Factions, notwithſtanding their differences in matters of Religion, ſhall yet conſpire in an uniform Obedience to the Civil Power, becauſe to be uppermoſt is that which they all deſire; and ſince the very ſame perſons are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Commonwealth, and of a particular Sect or Party, it is ridiculous to hope that the State can ever be quiet, till all theſe parties can agree together to be of the ſame mind; which is, to make them ceaſe to be what they are.</p>
                  <p>In the United Provinces, where the greateſt Liberty is given and taken of any other Territory in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, the peace of the publick could not be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, if it were not for the Overballance of the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>But yet notwithſtanding this, ſo great has the power and intereſt of the <hi>Louveſtane</hi> or <hi>Arminian</hi> Party alwaies been, that it has been the occaſion of great revolutions among them; and as it was probably one of the main cauſes of their ſo ſudden fall from the height of envy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the loweſt region of pity and deſpair within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of a very few years, ſo it is to be feared that in not many more (the animoſities between a <hi>Calviniſt</hi> and whoever differs from him being irreconcileable and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting) it will pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is to be confeſs'd indeed that there are abroad very great heats and contentions to be found, which are not of ſuch dangerous conſequence to the publick Peace, ſuch as are thoſe feuds, which will never be extinguiſh'd, betwixt the Seculars and the Regulars, and betwixt the regular Fraternities with one another; and, I believe, there are but very few monaſtick Societies will be found that are at peace within themſelves; of which, and of the cauſes of it, which I have well conſidered, I could ſay more, if it would not be a digreſſion; but whether it be that common obedience which they pay their Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope, which keeps them in ſomewhat better order, or, that being men of a ſingle life, not encumbred with any ſecular intereſt or concern, their animoſities cannot ſo eaſily embroile the State as thoſe who have a greater intereſt in it, and who may with a better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance purſue ſecular deſigns than they can doe; or, whether it be that the Laiety think it not worth their while, any further than it is matter of common enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and diſcourſe, to take any part in the quarrels of Beadeſmen and of Beggars; or whether it be that their contentions are not of ſuch a popular nature as to have an influence upon any but themſelves who make them; or that the perpetual auſterities of their reſpective rules, which are a conſtant emploiment to them, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from being capable of proſecuting any dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

                  <p>But I would by no means be ſo far miſunderſtood, as if I were ſo uncharitable as to think that all, or ſo much as the greateſt part of thoſe that ſeparate, doe it out of any bad deſign; for I am not onely morally certain of the contrary, as to the much greater number of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but as to the Paſtors themſelves, if that be any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:172970:97"/> for them; I dare be confident, in very many inſtances, that <hi>the blind lead the blind,</hi> and that they are not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of thoſe diſmal inconveniences to which their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is naturally expoſed; but in what I have juſt now ſaid I chiefly reflect upon the ſad experience of former times, which is ſufficient to convince us, what the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine tendencie of theſe new models is; and I do no more queſtion that the ſame cauſes, if ſuffered to operate with the ſame freedom, will have the ſame effect, than I do, whether humane nature and humane paſſions be the ſame now that they were twenty or thirty years ago; which Conſideration if all well-meaning, but miſguided Chriſtians would ſeriouſly lay to heart, I cannot doubt but it would ſoon have a very wonderfull effect upon the Peace and Settlement of theſe diſtracted Kingdoms, by perſuading all that heartily wiſh the Proſperity of <hi>Sion</hi> and pray for the Peace of this our ſpiritual <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to leave their ſeparate Aſſemblies, and betake themſelves into the boſom of the Church, which cannot behold ſo much goodneſs and ſincerity ſo miſerably miſled and gon aſtray without all the concern that is natural to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed, forſaken Mother, and ſtands alwaies ready with her arms wide open, and with an entreating voice and mind to receive them into her moſt tender and paſſionate embraces.</p>
                  <p>Some ſort of Unity as to external Diſcipline is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the conſiſtence even of thoſe leſſer bodies; nay, the Quakers themſelves who are much the moſt exorbitant of all Parties to be found among us, yet they differ from others, and agree with one another in nothing more than in a certain Formality peculiar to themſelves: And how much more deſirable would it be, that all Parties, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide their reſpective heats and animoſities which under ſuch diverſity of outward forms they ſo dangerouſly foment and carry on againſt each other, ſhould unite together
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:172970:98"/> under one common rule in ſuch a bleſſed band of Peace and Love, as would remove all our Jealouſies, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all our Fears, and make every man in the Streets in an unknown Face, to meet <hi>his Guide, his Companion, and his own familiar Friend?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is my firſt Anſwer to the Objection taken from the pretence of a Tender Conſcience, That an Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of one ſort or other, is of abſolute neceſſity to the peace of the Church; which Uniformity ſince it cannot be obtained, unleſs men could all jump into the ſame mind of themſelves, and continue in it when they had done, it follows unavoidably that there is, and muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be in the Church a ſtanding Authority, from whence the Sanctions of Diſcipline and Order ſhall receive their obligation.</p>
                  <p>I come now to give a more particular Anſwer to the Objection propoſed, and in that, I ſhall conſider in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral what the terms of this Uniformity muſt be, or rather what kind of terms they are to which all Chriſtian Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are obliged to ſubmit.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be granted therefore, That though an Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in Religious Worſhip be that which is above all things in this World the moſt paſſionately to be deſired, yet this being only in order to that great End, to which all our endeavours and counſels ought to be directed, the Eternal happineſs and ſalvation of our Souls; no terms of Uniformity ought to be ſubmitted to which are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Salvation. And that Church, whatever ſhe is, let her pretences to Infallibility and Truth, be never ſo great, which impoſes thoſe either Opinions or Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as the terms of Communion, which are directly contrary to the word of God, or to the light of Nature and the impartial dictates of right Reaſon is by no means to be communicated with any longer; but we muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately come out from Her and ſeparate in our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:172970:98"/> leſt we be made partakers of Her ſins and of Her plagues; and in this caſe it is ſhe who is guilty of the Schiſm by neceſſitating a Separation, not we who ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate when we cannot avoid it.</p>
                  <p>As to matter of Doctrine, I preſume there is no man who calls himſelf a Proteſtant, of what Denomination or Party ſoever he be, who will charge our Church with any damnable Errour; but on the contrary, there are many of our Diſſenting Brethren, who, when they are tax'd with the unpleaſant imputation of propagating very abſurd and very unreaſonable Opinions, are uſed to take Sanctuary in the Articles of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> of whoſe Authority, as to ſome points, they will pretend themſelves to be the only Aſſertors, with what Juſtice, I think I have in part diſcovered in ſome other Papers.</p>
                  <p>As to Ceremonies there are three Reſtrictions chiefly to be conſidered, which if they be all carefully obſerved in the diſcipline of any Church, there is no manner of pretence or ground for Separation upon a Ceremonial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and thoſe three Reſtrictions are theſe which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. <hi>Firſt,</hi> They muſt not be too cumberſome and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy by their number. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They muſt not be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious in their uſe. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They muſt not be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous in their direction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> They muſt not be too cumberſome and heavy by their number, for this is that which eats out the very heart and root of Religion, and takes it off from being a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votional exerciſe of the mind, by turning it into outward Pomp and Show, which can neither make us better men for the future, nor appeaſe the wrath of God, or apply to us the merit and ſatisfaction of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for what is paſt.</p>
                  <p>This was that of which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his time complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but yet he did not think it Lawfull to make any breach or diſtrubance in the Church upon this account, but rather to take this occaſion for the exerciſe of thoſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:172970:99"/> two excellent vertues of Patience and Humility, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the good time when this burthen ſhould be remov'd by the ſame regular Authority that had impos'd it.</p>
                  <p>This was the caſe of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Bondage, eſpecially as that Bondage was afterwards increaſed by the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or by the traditionary Rites and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church; and this is at this day, and was at the time of the Reformation, and for many Ages before, the caſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoak; from which the Wiſdome and Piety of our Anceſtours, has with no leſs Juſtice than Neceſſity freed us, and plac'd us in that ſtate of Chriſtian Liberty, which does not conſiſt of ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from all Ceremonies as ſome men ſeem to deſire; which is abſurd and impoſſible in the nature of the thing it ſelf, but in the choice of ſuch as are beſt fitted to the ends for which all Ceremonies ought to be deſigned, and have the greateſt tendency to Edification.</p>
                  <p>There were other cauſes upon account of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies impoſed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to juſtify a Separation, of which I ſhall ſpeak in the two following Heads.</p>
                  <p>And though a National or Provincial Church have a Right and Power within it ſelf of retrenching the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſluities of the Ceremonial part of their Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which may very well be done without any Schiſm or Separation from the body of the Church abroad, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the one part or the other: Yet for private men to ſeparate from the National Eſtabliſhment, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that the Ceremonies are too burthenſome or too many, is manifeſtly unlawfull. The reaſon is, becauſe this will be lyable to the ſame Inconveniences, to which a ſeparation upon pretence of greater Purity, is expos'd; and in both caſes, if every private man ſhall be allow'd to judge for himſelf, and to proceed to a Separation in purſuance of that judgment, ſo infinite are the humours,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:172970:99"/> the ſancies, the prejudices, the perverſities of ſome men; ſo fond are they of Novelty and Change, ſo apt to controul Authority, and ſo deſirous to be govern'd only by their own Meaſures, that there can be no laſting Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in the World, but the Diſcipline of the Church will be alwaies reeling like a Drunken Man, and driven to and fro like a Wave of the Sea, by every Capricious wind of Innovation.</p>
                  <p>We will ſuppoſe for the preſent, in favour of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, becauſe they cannot prove it, that there are too many Ceremonies in our Church, yet I preſume it will be granted that there are not above four or five, or half a dozen too many; or if you will, to make it a plump number, and to put the Objection into better ſhape, let them be half a ſcore, which I believe upon an exact computation, will go a great way in the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and let all theſe be impoſed as indiſpenſable conditions of Communion: 'Tis pretty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere I confeſs, to lay ſo great a ſtreſs upon Indifferent Matters; but yet certainly no man in his wits will ever pretend that this is ſuch an intollerable burthen, as that he muſt needs ſeparate rather than comply; but if there be any that are ſo hardy to do it, though I will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them for their courage, a vertue, of which in this contentious Age we have a great deal of need; yet in my opinion they deſerve rather to be ſoundly Laught at, than ſeriouſly Confuted.</p>
                  <p>What hath been ſaid of the Churches Power in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching the number of her Ceremonies, the ſame is likewiſe true as to the Ceremonies themſelves, that they may from time to time be altered and changed for others in their ſtead by the Authority of the Church, as ſhall ſeem moſt Expedient to that publique Wiſdome for the great Purpoſe of Edification; but for every private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to challenge this Right to himſelf, is unlawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:172970:100"/> liable to the ſame inconveniences, with ſeparating under colour of Ceremonious Superfluities, or of purer Ordinances and purer Ordinances and purer Worſhip, which are therefore juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſuſpected to proceed out of a bad deſign, becauſe they never can have any end.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in ſeveral places of his Epiſtles, expreſſes great tenderneſs for the infirmity of the weak Brother, but yet, if the Inſtances of ſuch his condeſcention be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, they will be ſound to be of a quite different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from thoſe which make up the pretences of our daies, as conſiſting, firſt, in the eating of things ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to Idols, which as looking like a participation of the table of Devils, and as being expreſly prohibited by a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Canon of the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> muſt needs give very great offence and ſcandal to the Chriſtians of thoſe daies, who did not underſtand ſo well as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did that <hi>an Idol was nothing,</hi> and that the conſideration of the Food might well enough be preſcinded from that of the Idol, and that therefore it was lawfull for one who was well grounded in the reaſon of things and might doe it without offence to any weaker than himſelf, to <hi>eat whatever was ſold in the ſhambles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From which laſt cited place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> we may obſerve a threefold difference in the practice of thoſe times as to this Affair. Firſt, There were ſome, and they the moſt perfect Chriſtians, in which number St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was, who would make no ſcruple of eating the <hi>Idolathyta,</hi> though they knew them to be ſuch, ſo they might doe it without ſcandal to others. Secondly, There were others who could not juſtifie to themſelves the eating of ſuch food; but yet, by Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s permiſſion, they would not be at the pains of a ſolicitous enquiry, but ſuffering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to remain in ignorance would <hi>eat whatſoever was ſold in the ſhambles, asking no queſtion for conſcience ſake.</hi> Laſtly, There were a third ſort, more ſcrupulous
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:172970:100"/> than either of the former, who thought themſelves bound not to eat any manner of meat but what they were ſure had not been ſacrific'd to Idols, and it is to theſe eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s condeſcention is with abundance of equity and juſtice made, becauſe their ſcruple was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not in a Circumſtance or Ceremony onely, but in a deep ſenſe of Devotion, and in a jealouſie for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God and Religion.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Inſtance of this Tenderneſs of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s is taken from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Abſtinence <hi>from things ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and from bloud,</hi> which was not onely ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by the Ceremonial law, but alſo continued and confirmed by the ſame temporary Edict of the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Synod; and what hath been ſaid of Abſtaining from Bloud, the ſame was true likewiſe of Circumciſion, which in ſome caſes was diſpenſed with even after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to Chriſtianity; this was the reaſon why <hi>Paul</hi> circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the 16th. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and it is his advice in the firſt to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, c. 7. v. 18. Is any man called being circumciſed? let him not become uncircumciſed: is any called in uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion? let him not be circumciſed.</hi> And then it follows, For <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and uncircumciſion is nothing, but the keeping of the Commandments of God.</hi>

                  <p>What is meant in this place by <hi>becoming uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> is needleſs to my purpoſe at preſent to examin and ſcarce conſiſtent with Modeſty to explain.</p>
                  <p>But that which is more pertinent to my deſign at preſent to take notice of is this, that in both theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of abſtaining from Bloud and of Circumciſion, the caſe is far different from the ſcruples of our daies; ſince it was not the ſqueamiſh averſation of a Ceremonie, but an obſtinate adherence to the Ceremonial Law on which thoſe ſcruples were founded, with which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> as it were on purpoſe to ſhow
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:172970:101"/> how little an enemie he was to Ceremonies was pleaſed for the time to diſpenſe, although the retaining of thoſe two Ceremonies in the Church, purſued into thoſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencies of which they were not ſenſible, did in reality include in it a Denial of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>For Circumciſion, what was it but the Seal of that particular Covenant which God had entred into with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his Poſterity? whereas now that encloſure was laid open and that partition wall was broken down; the renting of the vail in ſunder at the inſtant of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Paſſion was to ſignifie the final abolition, antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and repealment of the <hi>Abrahamitical</hi> Covenant and <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, the Holy of Holies was at that inſtant lay'd open, whereinto not onely the High prieſt with Sacrifices once a year, but all mankind by virtue of that great propitiatory Sacrifice which was at that time offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up upon the Croſs, without any other Sacrifice of their own than that of <hi>a broken ſpirit and a contrite heart</hi> might enter and be happy; and there was now rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a <hi>New and better Covenant, eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes,</hi> whereinto not the <hi>Jews</hi> onely, but all men that would accept of the conditions of the Goſpel, of what ſort or quality or Nation ſoever they were, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jew or Gentile, bond or free, Greek or Barbarian,</hi> had a free and welcome admittance; and it was in this ſenſe onely that the Promiſe was litterally fulfilled to <hi>Abraham</hi> that <hi>his ſeed ſhould be as the ſtars of heaven, and as the ſands of the ſea ſhore for number;</hi> that is, not the carnal, but the ſpiritual ſeed, which was much lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the other; <hi>Rom. 9. 6, 7, 8. For they are not all Iſrael which are of Iſrael: Neither becauſe they are the ſeed of Abraham, are they all children, but in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called: That is, They which are the children of the fleſh, theſe are not the children of God: but the children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed:</hi> And
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:172970:101"/> again, <hi>Gal. 3. 29. If ye be Chriſt's, then are ye Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Abſtinence from Bloud, though it be not ſo much a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Inſtitution, but was as old as the Creation it ſelf, and continued all along in force till our Saviour's time; yet then its obligation, together with its reaſon, was to ceaſe, the reaſon given in the Law, which was the ſame before it, being this; that God had given it upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, to be an attonement for the ſouls of men: it is mani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſt therefore, that when the Sacrifice and the Oblation ceaſed, as they actually did upon the ſuffering of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as to their efficacy and virtue, and as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> had long before expreſly propheſied it ſhould doe; I ſay, when the Sacrifices were no longer allowed in which this legal Abſtinence was founded, it is plain the Obligation to the Abſtinence it ſelf muſt ceaſe together with it, becauſe, <hi>ſublatâ causâ tollitur effectus:</hi> that Cauſe upon which Abſtinence was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned being now finally antiquated and aboliſh'd, the Effect that Cauſe, which was this Abſtinence from Bloud, muſt of neceſſity be ſuppoſed to be abrogated likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>But yet, I know not how it came to paſs, not onely the converted <hi>Jews</hi> in the Apoſtolical times, but the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians for many Ages together did generally abſtain from Bloud, and this Abſtinence has not wanted very learned Aſſertors even in our daies, <hi>Curcelleus</hi> has written a particular <hi>Diatriba</hi> or <hi>Diſſertation, De eſu ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis,</hi> wherein he defends this practice, with what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs I leave others to determin, when they ſhall have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what I have here ſaid; to which I will now adde, to ſtrengthen the Demonſtration, that that Text of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s which I have already cited, <hi>whatſoever is ſold in the ſhambles, that eat, asking no queſtion for conſcience ſake,</hi> may as well refer, and does as neceſſarily doe ſo,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:172970:102"/> to a permiſſion of Eating the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which we Tranſlate, <hi>things Strangled,</hi> and to the Repealment of the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Blood; as to the <hi>Idolothyta,</hi> or things Offered up in Sacrifice upon the Table of Idols. For they could not eat whatſoever was ſold in the Shambles, without eating many times ſuch meat as was not killed with that exquiſite Accuracy for the draining of the Blood which was peculiar to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and derived afterwards to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from them.</p>
                  <p>A particular Inſtance of this exceeding Care and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude of theirs, we have 1 Sam. 14. v. 32. <hi>And the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple flew upon the Spoil, and took Sheep and Oxen and Calves, and ſlew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with the blood;</hi> that is, lying upon the ground the Blood could not ſo eaſily be drained out of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that was made; and beſides, the Blood flowing about them, polluted and the ground where they lay, and defiled the Skins of the Beaſts that were killed, which put the whole Animal in a ſtate of <hi>Levitical</hi> Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and that which made the touching of Blood to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a Defilement, was this, that by the <hi>Levitical</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the Blood was of an Expiatory nature, and was always Offered up by the expreſs Command of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the door of the Tabernacle, as long as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſojourned in the Wilderneſs; and ſo being ſpilt by way of Expiation, it was ſuppoſed to be Defiled with the Guilt of the Owner and his Family, who were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to partake of the Fleſh, and therefore was Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, as all Expiatory Sacrifices were; as is manifeſt, not only from the reaſon of the thing, Expiation being a Tranſlation of Guilt, and Guilt the cauſe of Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but alſo from the Rites of the Sin, and the Treſpaſs Offering; which in ſome caſes were by reaſon of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs to be burnt without the Camp, and the Skins of theſe Sacrifices did not belong to the Prieſt as in ſome other caſes, becauſe they were unclean.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:172970:102"/>
                  <p>Now though it is true that after the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> were ſettled in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> this Cuſtome of bringing all Animals to be ſlain at the door of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, was omitted, and indeed was utterly Imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable by reaſon of the great diſtance of many parts of <hi>Judea</hi> from the Temple and Tabernacle; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, God did not by this loſe that Right which he had appropriated to himſelf in the Blood, but it was in the nature of a tacit or ſuppoſed Sacrifice in behalf of the Owner, and thoſe that partook with him of the Fleſh, though it were not ſprinkled by the Prieſt before the Lord, as the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> if by reaſon of Diſtance it had not been impoſſible, would have required.</p>
                  <p>By this it appears how the Beaſts that were killed in this place of <hi>Samuel,</hi> came to be defiled, and unlawfull to be eaten.</p>
                  <p>Let us now ſee which was the thing I firſt intended, what care was taken by <hi>Saul</hi> for the redreſs of this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or at leaſt to make ſome amends for it, <hi>v. 33, 34. Then they told</hi> Saul, <hi>ſaying, Behold the people ſin againſt the Lord in that they eat with the blood. And he ſaid, ye have tranſgreſſed, roul a great ſtone unto me this day. And</hi> Saul <hi>ſaid, diſperſe your ſelves among the people, and ſay unto them, bring me hither every man his Ox, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man his Sheep, and ſlay them here, and ſin not againſt the Lord in eating with the Blood: And all the people brought every man his Ox with him that night, and ſlew them there.</hi> Nay, it is probable that the Blood was alſo ſprinkled from the hands of the Prieſts; for it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the next Verſe. <hi>And</hi> Saul <hi>built an Altar unto the Lord, the ſame was the firſt Altar that he built unto the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon of that Command of his, of rouling a Stone to the place where the Beaſts were to be killed, was this, That they were to be laid athwart it with their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:172970:103"/> N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ks hanging down, that ſo the blood might flow with the greater freedom out of the Orifice which was made; and might fall upon the ground without defiling the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Animals themſelves; as I have already taken notice in another Diſcourſe upon a very different Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from this, and in another Language.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> continue Obſtinate to this day in a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous abſtinence from Blood, notwithſtanding their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be demoliſhed, and they do not ſo much as pretend to any thing of Sacrifice till it be rebuilt; and I know a Learned <hi>Jew,</hi> with whom I had for ſome years a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular acquaintance, who was ſo ſcrupulous in this point, that he would never eat any kind of Fleſh which he had not killed himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But before I paſs any further, I will take notice of one cauſe of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Condeſcention, as to the buſineſs of Abſtinence from Blood, which I did not think of before. And that is, That beſides what I have ſaid of its <hi>Levitical</hi> Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, which it ſeems they that were the Patrons of this Opinion, did not apprehend to be aboliſhed by the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of all thoſe legall Sacrifices in and by the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they conſidered further, that God having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated the Blood to himſelf; which Property and Right of his they did not conceive him ever to have relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht, they looked upon it as a kind of Sacrilege to ſeed upon Blood; and therefore abſtained from it upon the ſame Pious principle, upon which they would have abſtained from Robbing of Hoſpitals or Colleges, or from Pilfering the Ornaments of Churches, and ſeizing the Revenues of the Eccleſiaſtical State; a ſort of Piety ſo neceſſary to the honour of God, and to the proſperity and happineſs of the Church, that it ought by no means to be diſcouraged, though in a miſtaken Inſtance; much more if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf foreſaw, which we cannot tell but he might, that Sacrilegious humour of the Saints
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:172970:103"/> which our times have experienced, when the Church was ſwallowed up at one Morſel, and the Kingdome at another; when all that was Sacred and Devoted to the ſervice of Almighty God, was converted to profane uſes by Thieves and Robbers in the diſguiſe of Saints; with as little reaſon as that for which <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted <hi>Apollo</hi> of his Golden Ornaments, upon Pretence that they were too heavy and too hot for Summer, and that in Winter they would not keep him warm.</p>
                  <p>We ſee therefore that it was not a bare Infirmity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any colour or pretext of Reaſon that was diſpenſed with in theſe caſes; for ſuch Diſpenſations if they be once allowed, there can be no end but Confuſion and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Subverſion of all manner of Government and Order. We ſee upon what reaſons and prejudices theſe Scruples were founded, and how neceſſary it was at that time to Comply with them: We ſee likewiſe that they were not matters of ſmall Weight and Moment, they were not things looked upon on both ſides to be of an indifferent nture, they were not <hi>Controverſiae de Nugis Siculis &amp; Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris Germanis, de foliis Farfari aut Noevill Butubatis, de umbrâ Aſini, aut de lanà Caprinâ,</hi> they were not matters of meer Ceremony and Show, matters of External Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Form, that exerciſed the tenderneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of thoſe times. Thoſe Babes in <hi>Chriſt</hi> that were but newly initiated into the Chriſtian Faith, and had as yet taſted only the ſincere milk of the Word, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing upon ſtronger meats, were yet better fed and better taught, than to quarrel about Indifferent Matters, or to Controul their Governours in things of Publique-Decency and Order. But the inſtances of their Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity, were founded in ſuch things as they looked upon to be in themſelves Offences of the higheſt nature againſt the expreſs Commands of God, againſt the honour of his Name, againſt the entire and incommunicable reſpect
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:172970:104"/> which is due from all Creatures both in Heaven and Earth to his Adorable Majeſty and Greatneſs, and againſt the indiſpenſable duties of natural Reaſon and Religion; in which though they were never ſo much miſtaken, yet theſe were Scruples not of ſmall Concernment, but of the higheſt Conſequence and Importance; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> did therefore comply with the Infirmity and with the miſtakes of thoſe Good Men, not barely to gratify a ſqueemiſh Fancy, which is out of love with things for no rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on and without any end; but leſt by oppoſing Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices ſo deeply rooted in matters of ſo extraordinary a nature as theſe were, they might be tempted to an Apoſtacy from the Chriſtian Faith, which did impoſe burthens upon them which their Conſciences, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eing yet ſufficiently informed of the true extent of that liberty which <hi>Chriſt</hi> had purchas'd for them, could not poſſibly bear; for this reaſon, it was Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s rule to <hi>become all things to all men, that he might ſave the more;</hi> and he deſpenſed with them in ſome caſes out of meer neceſſity, that his Brother, <hi>for whom Chriſt dyed,</hi> might not be deſtroyed, by Relapſing to <hi>Judaiſm</hi> on the one hand, or <hi>Idolatry</hi> on the other: As our Learned Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> and out of him the Accurate and Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctor <hi>Falkner,</hi> have obſerved. And this latter caſe of Idolatry was therefore the more tenderly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, becauſe the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaking of this very buſineſs, tells us, <hi>c. 6. v. 4, 5, 6. It is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightned, and have taſted of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the World to come, if they ſhall fall away to renew them again unto repentance, ſeeing they Crucify to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle <hi>c. 5. v. 16.</hi> tells us <hi>there is a ſin unto death: I do not ſay that he,</hi> that is our Brother, <hi>ſhall
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:172970:104"/> pray for it;</hi> that is, there is great danger that his Prayers will never be heard in behalf of ſuch a perſon; and what that Sin is he afterwards explains <hi>v. 21. Little Children keep your ſelves from Idols.</hi> And this is likewiſe very ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the practice of the Church in the Primitive times, who upon any ſuch Relapſe to Idolatry, were not uſed to receive the Apoſtate, though giving all imaginable demonſtrations of Repentance, into the boſom of that Church, which he had forſaken, by Sacramental Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, ſometimes at the very inſtant of Death, and ſometimes not till then; as is manifeſt from the caſe of <hi>Serapio,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>However, ſince Peace is the thing above all others, the moſt to be prized and valued, and with the greateſt paſſion and earneſtneſs to be deſired; ſince no kind of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline or external Form is any further neceſſary or ſo much as lawful than it ſhall be found to Contribute to this bleſſed end, ſince Rites and Ceremonies eſtabliſht in the Church, are in themſelves of a changeable nature, and ſince our Church her ſelf hath openly and expreſly declar'd, that ſhe is no longer deſirous to retain all or any of them than they ſhall be found expedient for Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I ſhould not be againſt cloſing with any Propoſition, let it be almoſt what it will, by which a laſting Peace and Settlement might be obtained.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe I think there are but three ways to be thought of in order to this end. The <hi>firſt</hi> of which is a Toleration of thoſe that differ from us in their ſeveral differences and diſtinctions. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> an Alteration of thoſe Cuſtoms and Uſages which are excepted againſt for others in their ſtead. And the <hi>third,</hi> an Abatement or Abolition of thoſe Ceremonies which are ſcrupled without any Reparation by the Subſtitution of others in their room: Therefore I ſhall ſpeak very brieſly to each of theſe particulars.</p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:172970:105"/>
                  <p>And firſt, A Toleration as it is commonly underſtood, is a Liberty from the Government for every man to ſay and do as he pleaſes in Religious matters for Conſcience ſake; or upon account of a tender Conſcience which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubmit it ſelf to the publique Rule; and ſuch a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as this is, I affirm to be directly and poſitively un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, becauſe it cuts the ſinews of Government in pieces, and lets the Rains looſe to all manner of miſrule and diſorder: For the truth of which I need only appeal to the Experience of former times, when by ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Toleration, the Kingdome was put into ſuch a floating and uncertain Poſture, that we had almoſt as many alterations in Government, as there were Sects and Parties that were to obey.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> when time was, having ſhaken off the Epiſcopal Yoak, as they were pleaſed, if not to think, yet at leaſt to pretend it to be; were as much for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity as other men, and urged the very ſame Arguments with great Judgment and Reaſon, againſt the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, which may now with irreſiſtable Force be retort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon themſelves; as the Moſt Reverend and Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably Learned, the Excellent Dean of Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> a ſingular Ornament and ſtrong Support of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church and State againſt their Enemies of both kinds, hath very Wiſely, and like himſelf, Obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Nay, to what exceſs of Riot a Toleration in its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Latitude will proceed, the extravagancies either in Opinion or Practice, or both, of the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> the <hi>Seekers,</hi> the <hi>Quakers,</hi> the <hi>Ranters,</hi> the <hi>Sweet-Singers,</hi> and the <hi>Family of Love,</hi> are a ſufficient witneſs; moſt of whoſe Opinions as they proceed only from Ignorance, or Melancholy, or a worſe cauſe, a Life ill ſpent, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſpend it amiſs for the future; ſo the Debaucheries and the Obſcenities of ſome of theſe Sects which I have named, under a pretence of I know not what Liberty,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:172970:105"/> are ſo great and ſo horrid, that I ſhould not have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, if I had received it from any other information than that of ſome who pretended with abundance of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveration, and in a Company not eaſily to be impoſed upon to ſpeak their own certain knowledge, and who, I have great reaſon to believe, would not goe about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive either me or any other man whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Or if it be thought too grating to reflect with ſo great, and, which is ſtill worſe, ſo juſt and ſo deſerved a Severity upon the Miſcarriages of our own Age, upon Religious Pretences; you may then conſult the Annals of Antiquity; and then <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Irenoeus</hi> will tell you, if you conſult them, that there was no Crime ſo horrid, nor any unnatural Beaſtlineſs ſo deteſtable to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, not yet corrupted and depraved by vitious habits, which the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> the <hi>Baſilidians,</hi> and the <hi>Valentinians</hi> did not practiſe; the inſtances of their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable turpitude being ſo horrid and ſo filthy, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member when I firſt read them, which I did in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Annals of the moſt learned Cardinal and Jeſuite, <hi>Coeſar Baronius,</hi> I could not believe he had quoted his Authours aright; and when upon a more narrow ſearch into the buſineſs I found he had not deceived me, I was amazed, and could ſcarce believe my own eyes, and to this day am very loth to believe, for the reſpect I bear to Mankind, that they are true.</p>
                  <p>But if ſuch Exorbitances in our Age, or any other, be the effects of Liberty, whether tolerated by others, or aſſumed upon what Pretences ſoever to our ſelves, then certainly, ſince humane Nature is alwaies the ſame, and being allow'd the ſame ſcope, will alwaies be guilty of the ſame or like Enormities, which, by the prevalence of bad example, and by the addition of impunity to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation will alwaies increaſe, inſtead of taking up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a dutifull compaſs of Sobriety and Moderation, ſuch
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:172970:106"/> an unbounded Liberty as this ought alwaies, by the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Severity of publick Juſtice, to be repreſs'd, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and reſtrained.</p>
                  <p>Neither muſt we be ſo vain to pretend, becauſe ſuch Enormities are not now uſually practiſed among thoſe that pretend to an higher degree of Saintſhip than their Neighbours, that therefore they never will; for we muſt not take our meaſures from the preſent ſtate of things, but we are to conſider what would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ollow upon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Government, to which theſe ſeparate Congregations have a clear and a natural tendency in themſelves, and then we will ſuppoſe, if you pleaſe, that ſuch Libertines as theſe, if upon ſuch infinite Pretences they do not ſeparate themſelves, ſhall be expelled the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Congregations to which they belong; but there being no publick Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, who ſhall hinder them from aſſociating into a Confederacy with one another? to which all that live as if there were no God, or have a deſire to live as if there were no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the World will immediately unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and betake themſelves thither for Protection, as to a Sanctuary of Liberty and Riot.</p>
                  <p>To ſay that ſuch things will never happen is as much as to ſay they never did; for whatever has been may be again, when humane Nature which is alwaies the ſame ſhall be joyned to the ſame unhappy circumſtances of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
                  <p>To ſay that theſe things, though they ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, will never be of any dangerous conſequence to the publick, becauſe the common Intereſt of Mankind will alwaies keep a prevailing Party in better order, is to ſet bounds to a bad example, and to the corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which is impoſſible; and beſides, to proceed upon this preſumption, without taking that courſe which is in its own nature the beſt fitted to prevent any ſuch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:172970:106"/> miſchief, which can onely be done by a regular and orderly Diſcipline, is to lean ſo much upon humane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities and upon our ſelves, that it is an high provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to Almighty God to withdraw his Grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it is impoſſible for any of us to perſevere in a conſtant and ſteady courſe of Vertue.</p>
                  <p>But we will ſuppoſe for once, let what Toleration will be granted, that things will never proceed to this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; but it is ſtill to be conſidered that all theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Congregations are <hi>Imperium in Imperio,</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a manner ſo many ſeveral Societies as there are ſeveral and independent Congregations, without any foreign Appeal, or Judge in Eccleſiaſtical matters; for at this rate it ſhall be at the Liberty of every private Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlour to preach what Doctrine he pleaſes, be it never ſo much to the diſturbance of the Government of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, as ſome of them doe at this time take a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable liberty in their Sermons: But if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the Government to aſſume to it ſelf a Judgment of what Doctrines tend moſt to the Eſtabliſhment of its peace and ſafety, it is much more lawfull for it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it ſelf in matters of Diſcipline, which are not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of ſo great moment, and which notwithſtanding being left undetermin'd will have the ſame effects; which it is for the intereſt of the World they ſhould be adjuſted after an uniform manner, and in which the Goſpel has left no rule, whereby we are to manage and govern our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>If the Government where we live ſhall impoſe ſuch things upon our Belief and Practice as are inconſiſtent with Salvation, contrary to the duties of natural and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion, and repugnant to ſuch Propoſitions of Belief as are expreſly revealed in the Scriptures of the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> then all we have to doe is, to ſuffer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, as our glorious Predeceſſors, the Apoſtles and the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:172970:107"/> primitive Chriſtians did, and we ſhall certainly have our reward in Heaven for ſo doing; but if we ſuffer one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for breaking the Rules of decency and order, which have been found by experience to be ſo neceſſary to the publick Peace, and which have no other tendencie, meaning or deſign, but in order to this end, unleſs we can alledge reaſonably what I ſhall by and by inſiſt upon, that there is Superſtition or Idolatry involved in our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, this is not Perſecution but Puniſhment, we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer either like Fools or Madmen, or, what is worſe than either of theſe, like <hi>Boutefeus,</hi> Incendiaries and Diſturbers of the quiet of mankind, and muſt not expect either the Title or the Reward of Confeſſours or Martyrs.</p>
                  <p>I reckon there are three Cauſes eſpecially of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Non-conformity from the eſtabliſhed Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Firſt is, The Ambition, or Neceſſity, or Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of ſome bad men who know very well what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages may be made for the promotion of any ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns by a Separation; neither is it any matter whether ſuch perſons be all of them actually liſted in ſome ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Aſſembly, ſo they do but abet and favour thoſe that are; but rather by paying a perſonal obedience to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, which they would have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, but enlarged, by breaking down that Wall of partition to which we have no right, becauſe the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have built it upon their own ground, by endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to let in the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe of Fanaticiſm through the Breaches of the Church, by very ſpecious, but very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and pernicious Pretences of moderation and comprehenſion, and ſuch other hard names, which can onely be underſtood by being felt; by a pretended ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of diſ-uniting Proteſtants, and yet at the ſame time uncharitably repreſenting the beſt Defenders of the Reformation under the odious and invidious Characters
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:172970:107"/> of <hi>Papiſts</hi> or <hi>Popiſhly affected;</hi> by queſtioning the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Biſhops in temporal cauſes, that by that means they may weaken their Eccleſiaſtical Power, by ſtriking at the King through the ſides of his loyal and well-affected Clergy; and by doing all this and a great deal more out of a diſſembled Zeal for Unity and Peace, and out of a paſſionate Concern for the Honour and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the King and Church, they doe abundantly more miſchief than either the Diſſenters themſelves, or they who are the moſt unmanageable and indiſcreet in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of a bitter and unchriſtian Animoſity againſt them; becauſe theſe, as being prejudiced and profeſs'd Parties, will not be heard ſo equally on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a ſecond Cauſe, though indeed in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of cauſality it may well enough deſerve the firſt place, of the Continuance of ſuch an unnatural Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among us, notwithſtanding there is ſo little or rather nothing at all to be ſaid in juſtification of ſo prejudicial and ſo unwarrantable a Practice, is the Neceſſity or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of thoſe who at the happy revolution of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's return, like <hi>the riſing of the Sun, with healing in his wings to heal the Sores</hi> of three divided Kingdoms, being ejected in great numbers out of thoſe Livings and Benefices of which they were then poſſeſſed, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>to digg,</hi> unleſs it were in the Vineyard, and being <hi>aſhamed to begg;</hi> being deſirous to reak their Revenge upon the Government, which had ejected them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that reaſon, becauſe it could not truſt them, and becauſe they would not obey it; being tainted with the Leaven of the <hi>good old Cauſe;</hi> being ſoundly ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with <hi>Democratical</hi> and <hi>Demagogical</hi> Principles of which it is very hard for a thorough Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth's man, eſpecially when he is no Philoſopher, to rid himſelf; being in ſome ſmall hopes, as drowning men are when they catch at a Reed, of reaping a new
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:172970:108"/> Harveſt out of the Church lands and out of the Spoils of the Crown; being encouraged and abetted by men of like Principles and Practices and Circumſtances with themſelves, by good old Officers that had been in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, by Proprietours that had loſt thoſe Tenements and Hereditaments that never were their own, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate Women that are naturally fond of Saintſhip and Perſecution, by Men that were Bigots to a Party, or Dependents upon an Intereſt, that wanted a Wife, or would oblige a Chapman, or inſinuate themſelves into a Laſt Will and Teſtament; by the Womens careſſing their Husbands, and the Husbands perſuading their Wives; by cauſes that cannot be juſtifi'd, and cauſes that muſt not be named, the black Fraternity of the ſhort robe were at length ſo far emboldened, as, notwithſtanding the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of thoſe wholeſome Laws, whoſe edge was rebated by the fatal Clemency of a too Gracious Prince, towards men that ought not to be truſted, and cannot be obliged, to own and juſtifie a Separation, which is now grown to that exceſſive height, that the Contention is no longer about Liberty, but Dominion; they break the Laws o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, without regard to Juſtice or to Shame, and to propagate a Succeſſion of Law-breakers like themſelves, they have ordained an Under-wood of Non-conforming Shrubs, who will in time grow up to be Cedars of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and come by the Prieſthood much by the ſame right and title that <hi>Oliver</hi> came by the Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourſhip, or <hi>Trincalo</hi> by his Dukedom: So that it is now with the Diſſenters as it was the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam's</hi> time, they have their ſeparate Aſſemblies and their diſtinct Altars, their Prieſts, not of the <hi>Levitical</hi> or <hi>Aaronical</hi> Tribe, much leſs of the more perfect <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedecian</hi> Order, but of the dreggs and refuſe of the People, and Calves in abundance, the Idols of the Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as far as from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Bethel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:172970:108"/>
                  <p>But Thirdly, a third Cauſe of that dangerous Non-conformity which prevails among us is, a certain ſort of Opiniatrity, or Affectation, or Newfangleneſs which in all Ages uſually poſſeſſes the ordinary ſort of People, by which they are alwaies apt to quarrel and find fault with the preſent Eſtabliſhment, let it be never ſo wholeſome; and if it were not for this Cauſe, the other two Cauſes which I have mentioned would want a ſubject upon which to work: but certainly, if men would ſeriouſly conſider with themſelves how dangerous all Innovations in the general are, and how deſtructive oftentimes to the publick Peace; how little moſt of them are like to get by Innovation, and how much they may loſe; how ſmall and inconſiderable, how unreaſonable and unwarrantable the preſent Differences are; how neceſſary it is there ſhould be ſome Eſtabliſhment, and how impoſſible that any ſhould pleaſe all; and that this is but to perpetuate quarrels by the nicety of ſome and the deſign of others, from one generation to another without any meaſure, moderation or end, to the inexpreſſible and unconceivable diſturbance of the World; they would not then think it worth their while to loſe the Quiet of their own minds, their Charity for others, and the good opinion of others for them, to crumble into Sects and Parties, to embroil us in infinite and inextricable Difficulties at home, and to expoſe us to the unavoidable Dangers of a foreign yoak, and a foreign Religion from abroad; onely to gratifie the Deſigns of proud, or diſcontented, or neceſſitous men; to feed Contempt and Ignorance themſelves, and to cloath Want of loyalty, learning, good nature and good manners.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, that the Wiſdome of this World is Fooliſhneſs with God, and that the Wiſdome of God is Fooliſhneſs with this World, and that they are oppoſite the one to the other; but then by the Wiſdome of this
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:172970:109"/> World, is meant, that Carnal Mind that hath a greater conſideration for a Temporal Intereſt, than for the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Truth and Vertue; for the Commands of God, or the precepts of the Goſpel; but that men that have little or no Learning of their own, and yet are unaſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe extraordinary helps of Utterance and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Illumination with which the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> times were furniſhed; men that are ſo far from underſtanding what Reaſon is, that they decry it; men that are ſteered wholly by conſiderations of Intereſt, by impulſes of Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by an habit of Prejudice and a principle of Revenge; that theſe of all others ſhould be thought the fitteſt to Inſtruct the People, and to have the care and conduct of ſuch precious things as are the Souls of men committed to their Charge; that theſe ſhould be thought worthy to be the inſtruments of our Confuſion, who have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wit nor the honeſty to make us Happy, who deſign us no Good, and can do us none if they did deſign it; is a thing which I am very confident, will find no manner of countenance from Scripture, and is utterly unable to plead the leaſt ſhadow of a Grant or Commiſſion from above.</p>
                  <p>An unlimitted Toleration muſt of neceſſity be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if any thing be; becauſe it contradicts the deſign for which all Laws are made, and that is nothing elſe but to ſecure the Peace and Quiet of the World; which muſt needs be very inconſiſtent with an unlimitted To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, by which nothing elſe is or can be meant, but a Liberty for every man to doe or ſay as he pleaſes, ſo he doe it upon a Religious account, or out of a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Conſcience, of which himſelf is the only judge in this caſe: to ſay otherwiſe, being to conſtitute ſuch a foreign Appeal, is altogether incompetible with ſuch a toleration.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:172970:109"/>
                  <p>Now if it can be proved that the allowance of ſeparate and independent Congregations, without any Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Eccleſiaſtical affairs, Foreign to themſelves, is ſuch an unlimitted Toleration in it ſelf, and will prove ſo in its Effects; then I ſuppoſe it will be granted, that all ſuch Separate Aſſemblies are unlawfull; and conſequently, that a Toleration of them cannot be allowed by the Chief Magiſtrate, or by the Legiſlative Power, without a Diſſolution of the Government, and a betraying of that Truſt which is repos'd in them for the preſervation of the publique Peace.</p>
                  <p>What if an <hi>Holder-forth</hi> in a Separate Aſſembly, ſhall teach his Auditours that they owe no ſubjection to any Earthly Prince, that Rebellion is expreſly diſpenſed with in the Charter of the Saints; that Adultery, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and Theft, and Murther, themſelves; though in the Wicked and the Unregenerate, they be horrid crimes; yet they are a part of the privilege of the Elect, that all ſorts of ſwearing are in the Reprobate unlawfull; but that Perjury it ſelf, in ſuch as are ſanctifi'd and made Partakers of that new Birth by which ſo many Monſters are brought into the World, may be not only Lawfull, but Pious and Commendable, and in ſome caſes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable Duty?</p>
                  <p>Shall the Government in this Caſe, Shall Civil or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Juriſdiction be allow'd to Interpoſe, by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſuch Profligate and ſuch Inſolent Wretches, and by forbidding under ſevere Penalties the venting of any ſuch Doctrines for the future, which tend ſo manifeſtly to withdraw his Majeſty's leige People from their Obedience, and to the unſpeakable perill and hazard of their immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls? If thus much be not allow'd, then all things muſt run to Confuſion; and if it be, then if the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Diſcipline be ſound by experience to be as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the publique Well-fare, to the peace of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:172970:110"/> Kingdome, and to the preſervation of Charity and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip among men; without which it is hardly poſſible there ſhould be any ſuch thing as true and acceptable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: then certainly it does as much belong to, and is as neceſſary a part of Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the other.</p>
                  <p>I know but two things that can poſſibly be urged againſt the irreſiſtible force of ſo plain a Demonſtration: I call it a Demonſtration, becauſe it will prove ſo when thoſe Objections are conſidered. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that there is no danger, ſuch Doctrines will ever be preached. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> That a Difference grounded meerly upon matters of Diſcipline, will never produce thoſe bad Effects that are pretended.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to the <hi>firſt,</hi> there are but two things to be ſaid, the firſt is an Argument from Reaſon, the ſecond from Experience. Reaſon tells us, and ſo does Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence too, for they cannot well be ſeparated in this caſe, that men are naturally ſubject to ſeek excuſes firſt to palliate, and then arguments to defend thoſe Vices to which they find themſelves addicted, and of which they are known to be ſcandalouſly guilty, or which they would practiſe for the future without controul.</p>
                  <p>The Drunkard, he puts his exceſs to the account of his friendſhip and good nature; the Luſtfull plead a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual inclination as a natural call to enjoyment; the Covetous man is deſirous of the character of Provident and Frugal; and the Ambitious would be thought a man of a loſty and heroique mind; but nothing is ſo great a plea for Libertiniſm and Licentiouſneſs of all ſorts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, as when it is made an Inſtance of Chriſtian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a Freedom from the Yoak of Ordinances; to which none but <hi>Jews</hi> and Formaliſts, and the tame Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of the dead Letter are ſubject.</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:172970:110"/>
                  <p>There is no queſtion to be made, but there are very bad People to be found in all Parties, let the Pretences to Religion be what they will; but it is not my buſineſs at preſent to upbraid any with their ſinfull practices, ſo they do not own the Principles from whence thoſe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices proceed.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall we think of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> of old time, that made adulterous and inceſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What ſort of People in the World are ſo arbitrary as theſe, who yet are the loudeſt Declamours not onely againſt Arbitrary Power, but againſt all Power but their own? The <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves are not more bloudy than they, nor any of the perſecuting <hi>Emperours</hi> more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acted and poſſeſs'd by a Spirit of bitterneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. To conclude; Did not the <hi>Levellers</hi> preach
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:172970:111"/> Community of goods, according to the primitive example, (though the reaſon of that practice be now utterly ceas'd) and to reduce the natural ſtate of things, when all things lay in common, before either Induſtry or Arts began? and what is this but a more religious method of Picking of Pockets and Breaking open Houſes and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing upon the High way? What was it but a new Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe pil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ering Saints, to give Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, like themſelves, a right to the glorious Title and Reward of Martyrdom?</p>
                  <p>Now if all theſe Miſchiefs and Inconveniences are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly to ſeparate Congregations, and to mens em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodying themſelves into particular Eccleſiaſtical Societies diſtinct from the publick Diſcipline and Rule; if ſuch O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and Practices cannot better be promoted than by independent methods, nor otherwiſe or at leaſt better be prevented than by an uniform and regular Diſcipline of the Church; then is it abundantly manifeſt that ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Congregations, as tending plainly to the diſturbance of the World, are unlawfull; that they may, and that they ought to be ſuppreſſed; and that all the Favourers and Abettors of ſuch unlawfull Aſſemblies, are Promoters, Aiders, Comforters and Aſſiſters of Rebellion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience both againſt God and Man.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it at all material in this caſe, that many of thoſe who frequent theſe ſeparate Aſſemblies, nay, to give them their due, the infinitely greateſt part of them, are not conſcious to themſelves of any ſuch bad Deſign, but they doe it onely out of a religious prejudice which they have conceived againſt the Eſtabliſhment of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and out of an opinion which they have of the greater Sanctity of their Teachers, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of thoſe Ordinances of which they are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers by their miniſtration, out of a real and an hearty zeal for God, although that zeal be not accord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ng to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:172970:111"/> knowledge, yet we are not to conſider ſo much what it is they deſign, as what the natural tendencie of all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is, which, becauſe by experience it is found to bring ſo great and ſo horrid inconveniences and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs upon the World, unleſs it be timely reſtrained, it may, and it muſt of neceſſity have very bad effects; and this is enough to make men guilty of the conſequences of their Separation, though at firſt they did not intend them. He that commits a fault through want of conſideration is not altogether ſo guilty as he that knowing it to be a fault, does yet notwithſtanding commit it on ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but yet he is guilty in his proportion and degree as well as the other, becauſe it was his duty to conſider better, and ſtill the more eaſie it is too for a man to inform himſelf: (and what is or can be more manifeſt than the Prejudice ariſing from mens embodying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into particular and independent Societies?) So much the greater is the guilt ariſing from the want of due heed and conſideration, becauſe a very little attention would have ſerved the turne, when there is ſo much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the thing, and ſo much experience to improve that reaſon into all the certainty of demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, It will be ſaid, That a bare difference in the externals of Religion, in matters of meer Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Ceremonie, will not produce thoſe bad effects that are pretended; and I wiſh with all my heart, that there were as much truth in this Exception as they that make it would have it ſeem to have; but, by Experience, which is the great Judge in this Controverſie, to which we muſt apply our ſelves for the diſcovery of the truth, the contrary does but too manifeſtly appear. For what is it that has been the true ſource and fountain of all our pablick Calamities, that has made ſo dreadfull and ſo terrible Convulſions both in Church and State, but an over-heated zeal againſt Ceremonies and publick Order,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:172970:112"/> which ſort of zeal, if it be tolerated, the ſtrength and beauty of the Church is loſt, by every man's purſuing fancies of his own, or ſiding with a new modell of a particular Party inſtead of joining in the regular and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Worſhip of the publick, which is at once an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our Obedience to the Divine and Humane Laws, and a certain expedient of Unity and Peace with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; but if this zeal, inſtead of being tolerated, ſhall be reſtrained and oppoſed, then it immediately complains of Perſecution, and would have its ſufferings thought as meritorious for raiſing unreaſonable, inſatiable and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Scruples, as if the Cauſe of Chriſtianity it ſelf were at ſtake, as if it were the being of a God or the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Souls of men that were deny'd by us, and aſſerted onely by the Diſſenters from the publick Order and Rule.</p>
                  <p>So that either way the inconvenience is in a manner equal, a Toleration has a manifeſt tendencie to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Government both in Church and State, and in that, there is no queſtion to be made, but it will certainly end, when once it has been ſuffered to have its full ſcope and ſwinge; and yet a vigorous Proſecution of the Laws againſt the Diſturbers of the Peace is branded with the odious name of Perſecution, and they that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by it, for being Incendiaries, are termed Saints; and becauſe it is natural for a diſtreſſed Cauſe to find a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and pity from the common People whether it be reaſonable or no, Suffering being a very ſenſible and a very affecting thing when the Cauſes of thoſe Sufferings are not ſo plain and obvious to every common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, eſpecially when blinded by prejudice or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the perſons of thoſe that ſuffer; from hence it comes to paſs that a juſt and neceſſary Proſecution of the Laws, if it be not managed with abundance of temper and prudence, ſo as it may appear it is not done out of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:172970:112"/> hatred to a Party, but out of a real tenderneſs to the common good, may ſometimes prove the occaſion of great and fatal diſorders in a State, and may in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:172970:113"/>
                  <p>But yet though Cruelty be that for which all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but they that exerciſe it upon others, have a juſt and mortal averſation, yet a Proſecution of all Penal Laws cannot be called Cruelty, unleſs it be Cruelty to govern, or to uſe the neceſſary and the onely means to keep the World in order; all Puniſhment is Cruelty, or at leaſt Injuſtice, which is inflicted is defence of a bad cauſe or a bad religion, but when the Penalties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves are not ſo ſevere as to deſerve the name of Cruel, and when they are inflicted for the Preſervation of a ſound and orthodox Religion, which I perſuade my ſelf moſt of the Diſſenters will acknowledge that of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be; when they are inſlicted for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Unity and Friendſhip among men, when this is the onely Expedient by which an univerſal Friendſhip and Charity can be maintained, by which the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be rendred ſafe in it ſelf and eaſie to thoſe that are to obey, by which we can be rendred quiet and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure at home, or conſiderable abroad, by which we can be put in the beſt capacity to reſiſt an Enemy or to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour an Ally, or to tranſmit the Profeſſion of the Goſpel in its native purity and beauty down to our own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and to their poſterity through all generations as long as time ſhall endure, whereas without this courſe we ſhall be ſubject to infinite changes and viciſſitudes in our Secular and in our Eccleſiaſtical Concerns, and ſhall be more dangerouſly expoſed, when our ſtrength by a Toleration is diſunited and broken in pieces, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of Idolatry, Superſtition, Infidelity, Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Prophaneneſs, and of all manner of Evil whatſoever it be; this is ſufficient to juſtifie a lawfull Power in the uſe of the onely means by which theſe Inconveniences may be avoided, and if it ſhall ſo happen, through the evil diſpoſition of men, that a Proſecution of the Laws, which is the onely poſſible expedient of Peace and Safety,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:172970:113"/> ſhall yet notwithſtanding produce the ſame miſchiefs and diſorders which a Toleration would have done, yet in this caſe the Magiſtrate will have the ſatisfaction in his own Conſcience and before God of having diſcharged his duty, and of not having betray'd that truſt which is repoſed in him; which in the other, as being a natural means to bring us all to confuſion, I do not ſee how he can ever have or expect.</p>
                  <p>The Contentions about matters of Diſcipline are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore manifeſtly of the higheſt importance, becauſe they occaſion a Separation, which is the fruitfull mother of all thoſe fatal miſchiefs both to Church and Kingdom that have been mentioned already, and can never be too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated, or too ſeriouſly reflected upon.</p>
                  <p>I would very willingly know of our Diſſenters what they think themſelves, upon ſuppoſition that the whole Nation were divided and parcell'd out into ſeparate and independent Congregations, which is that which an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Toleration would produce, whether or no its ſtrength wou'd be ſo firm and ſo compacted as it is now? To ſay it would, is to ſay that a divided intereſt can be as ſtrong as that whoſe parts are never ſo well compac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and knit to one another; and it is, beſides this abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the reaſon of the reaſon of the thing, to contradict the experience of our own Age and of all that have gone before it; to maintain the lawfulneſs of ſuch ſeparate Congregations, notwithſtanding thoſe many and diſmal inconveniences to which they are expoſed, is to affirm, that it is lawfull to endeavour the ſubverſion of the Government, which in this caſe will never be able to maintain it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſtanding Army, no more than in the times of uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation; and it will be very hard, if not impoſſible; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other incommodities and preſſures to which this way of adminiſtration is expoſed; that inſtead of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Laws, they ſhall not at ſome time or other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:172970:114"/> them, inſtead of making the Prince happy and his People ſecure, they ſhall not make both miſerable, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious and dependent; inſtead of agreeing together for the maintenance of the common peace and ſafety, they ſhall not fall out among themſelves, partaking of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical giddineſs of the People whom they pretend to ſerve, but are in reality their abſolute Lords and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and burn up all the ſences of Property and Right in the unnatural flames of an inteſtine War.</p>
                  <p>I demand farther, whether they can or do ſuppoſe, though God be thanked we are not yet brought to the utmoſt perſection of Tumult and Diſorder, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating of ſo many particular Congregations is not a weakning of the Government, as well as the dividing the whole Nation into ſuch independent Aſſemblies would be a ſubvertion of it? Certainly this depends in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion upon the ſame reaſon with the other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be deny'd; beſides, that the preſent poſture of affairs doth ſufficiently prove it to be true, when our Heats and Diſſentions about indifferent matters, as men are pleaſed to call them, have made us, from a Nation that was uſed to be the Umpire and the Arbiter of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> to become ſo inconſiderable as we are abroad, and ſo uneaſie and unſafe at home; beſides, that by our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions we encreaſe thoſe dangers of <hi>Popery</hi> which we pretend to dread; while by an univerſal, but deſerved cry againſt ſo deteſtable a Superſtition, we are heaping coals of fire upon our own heads againſt the day of wrath and perſecution if ever it prevail among us, and we provoke our Enemies with more zeal than prudence, unleſs we would join together, as we ought to do, in a common League to reſiſt them: ſo that it ſtill appears more and more evident, upon all conſiderations, that Uniformity is neceſſary to the publick ſafety; it is neceſſary to the honour and ſeemly appearance of the Government as well
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:172970:114"/> as to the happineſs of it: it appears likewiſe that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and independent Congregations are therefore unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, becauſe where there is no common juriſdiction there can be no common rule of diſcipline and order: it appears that a Toleration of ſuch independent Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, is a Toleration of uncharitableneſs and ſtriſe among men, and therefore as being directly and diametrically oppoſite to the very nature and temper of Chriſtianity, it muſt of neceſſity be unlawfull: laſtly it appears that humane impoſitions are lawfull, becauſe this Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, which is neceſſary to the quiet of the World and to the making Chriſtianity uſefull to ſo good an end can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be obtained without them.</p>
                  <p>Separation, let it be for what cauſe or upon what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſoever, does, as I have ſaid already, imply a diſlike, and does create an alienation of affection in the parties ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from one another, and therefore ſince a quarrel is much more eaſily ſomented than begun; ſince it is hard in many caſes for the beſt tempers to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:172970:115"/> there are parties or factions in that unhappy Church whoſe misfortune it is to be ſo miſerably divided: the conſideration of which cannot chuſe but affright every man who has any regard either of his own peace, or to that of his Countrey, by preſenting him with a diſmal Scene of a Church divided and mangled into ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing bodies, ſeparated in all reſpects from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as it were, drawn up in <hi>Battalia,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting onely the Signal of opportunity or advantage on any ſide to begin a bloudy encounter; which they that complain ſo heavily of Perſecution themſelves (when they have ſo little reaſon, and when they at the ſame time perſecute the Government and all that favour it with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny and detraction, which is a very grievous ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution) will certainly doe whenever it ſhall lie in their power. They having not onely given us a ſufficient ſpice of their temper in the late times, to teach us not to truſt them any more or any farther than needs muſt; but it is ſcarce longer ago than yeſterday, that the tender Conſciences were indulged ſo long till they grew too hard for the Government, and it is but too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, by their words and actions in that critical junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that if they had gained their point, which was the ſubverſion of the preſent eſtabliſhment diſguiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſpecious pretences of uniting Proteſtants, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be united by any thing but a publick Form and Ritual of Divine Service; they would ſoon have ſhewn us what opinion they have of their pretended <hi>Diana</hi> Toleration, a Goddeſs never worſhipt in the publick Temples, and a word that never ſounds pleaſantly, but to thoſe that want the thing.</p>
                  <p>So that an univerſal Toleration of all parties and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being manifeſtly proved to be naturally unlawfull, to be attended with infinite inconvenience and miſchief both to the publick and particular perſons, of which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:172970:115"/> the body politick it ſelf is made up, as the whole is but an aggregate of ſeveral parts conſidered as one, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up together, there remains now nothing farther to be conſidered under the topick of conceſſion, but that either we alter ſome ceremonies which have affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded matter or pretence of ſcruple for others in their ſtead, or that we do totally aboliſh whatever is excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, without any ſupplement or reparation: For the firſt of theſe, it is granted by ſuch as ſhall deſire it, that an impoſition in the general is lawfull, otherwiſe it would be ridiculous to talk of ſubſtituting other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the ſtead of thoſe that are aboliſh'd, when the very ſubſtitution it ſelf is made an exception againſt them, it behoves thoſe perſons therefore who are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of ſuch an alteration, ſince by the deſire it ſelf they do imply an acknowledgment, that a ſubſtitution, that is, a new impoſition may lawfully be made, and by conſequence that an impoſition in the general conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered is not unlawfull; I ſay, it concerns them to ſhew ſome particular reaſon, beſides the impoſition, of their diſlike of the Ceremonies which are already in uſe; for otherwiſe if we muſt alter them for no reaſon, we can have no certainty that this innovating humour will ever have an end, neither is it poſſible to make any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſtruction of it, but that it proceeds out of a deſign to give an endleſs diſturbance to the publick peace, notwithſtanding it pretends to eſtabliſh and ſecure it. And as for thoſe, in the ſecond place, that are for abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing without a reparation, the caſe will be the ſame again; for either they are againſt thoſe Ceremonies, which they would have aboliſhed, merely for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon becauſe they are impoſed, and then it is manifeſt they ought not to be heard, becauſe this, like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> with an honeſt perhaps, but yet a blind fury, and a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken zeal pulls up the very Pillars of Government from
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:172970:116"/> their natural baſis, and deſtroys the onely expedient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven of publick ſafety, ſecurity and peace; it makes the very worſhip of God it ſelf precarious and uncertain, and expoſes it at every turn to the deſign of Knaves, the deſtructive zeal of Madmen and Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſts, the libertiniſm of Epicures and voluptuary perſons, to the ſcorn of Atheiſts, and the contempt of all wiſe, conſiderate and ſober men; there muſt therefore ſtill be another reaſon aſſigned why the Ceremonies that are boggled at ſhould be aboliſhed, and thoſe reaſons can be none but one of thoſe three that have been mentioned already, either they are too cumberſome by reaſon of their number, or they are ſuperſtitious in their uſe, or they are idolatrous in their direction.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe particulars hath been already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; and as to the ſecond, a Ceremony may be ſaid to be ſuperſtitiouſly uſed, when we aſcribe to it ſome Phyſical virtue or efficacy, or ſome ſupernatural effect which it hath not, or when we ſay that by or together with it, grace is conferred, as in the two Sacraments of Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper; but we do not affirm this of any of our Ceremonies, and our Church hath expreſly declared that ſhe intends nothing by them but onely peace, and decency, and edification; and for the uſe of the Croſs in Baptiſm, which is the great thing ſcrupled under this head of Superſtition, ſhe does expreſly declare that it doth not at all belong to the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of it, that the Baptiſm is compleat without and before it, that it is onely a declarative rite of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being liſted under Chriſt's Banner, of our being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to his ſervice, who for our ſakes underwent ſo painfull and ſo ignominious a death, of our not being aſhamed of that Croſs which the Son of God himſelf underwent, and of our willingneſs, if occaſion be, to take up our Croſs and follow him through much
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:172970:116"/> tribulation and ſufferings into the glory of the Father. So that here there are but two things to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, either this Rite is unlawfull becauſe it hath been ſuperſtitiouſly abuſed by thoſe in the Romiſh Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and then upon the ſame account kneeling at our Prayers will be unlawfull, becauſe the Papiſts kneel to the hoſt, which yet, I preſume, none of the Diſſenters will be ſo hardy to ſay; or elſe, ſecondly, it will be ſaid, as ſome of them do, that it is therefore unlawfull becauſe it is a Ceremony of a ſymbolical or ſignificative nature, which is very ſtrange, as if a Ceremony could be unlawfull, onely for that reaſon, becauſe it tends to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, as it is the nature of a ſignificant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to do. And here indeed is a great and common miſtake concerning indifferent things, as we do uſually, but falſely call them; for though we do not ſay, that any one Ceremony hath any ſuperſtitious efficacy or virtue in it, or that it can never upon any conſideration be changed or omitted, or that it is of abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in order to ſalvation, yet this muſt be confeſſed at the laſt, that many things are not ſo indifferent, as they are uſually eſteemed.</p>
                  <p>It is very fit and conſequently a duty, that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ſhould go attired in black rather than in colours, that they ſhould wear long robes rather than ſhort, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhort hair than long, becauſe it will always be, that the latter of theſe will in the minds of all men create a ſenſe of levity, a diſpoſition to contempt, an opinion of luxury and effeminate ſoftneſs, whereas the former in the common interpretation of Mankind will always have a grave and a majeſtick appearance, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlect authority, credit, and an opinion of ſobriety and ſtaidneſs upon him that wears them; and if the perſon be unlike what he appears, his habit which was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among other things for a mark of diſtinction, will be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:172970:117"/> the greater and the more deſerved reproach to him. The Nonconformiſts themſelves are ſo ſenſible of this, that they themſelves wear black, for no good reaſon but what is ſymbolical, though they condemn that account of any thing we doe in us, and they wear long cloaks too, though Gowns and Caſſocks they have nothing to doe with, and therefore they do ſtill remain in a ſtate of ſuperſtition and uncleanneſs, onely for that reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are longer, that is, more grave, more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, more authoritative, becauſe they preach better and perſwade more effectually than ſhort ones.</p>
                  <p>The Surplice, a thing ſo much decryed and talked againſt by ſome, what is it to the Layety? or how come they ſo deeply to ſcruple it in others, who are not obliged to wear it themſelves? if they ſcruple it for no reaſon but onely becauſe they are not, that is, they will not be ſatisfied, a man can as little tell where ſuch an unaccountable ſcrupuloſity will end, as from whence it begins or upon what reaſon it is founded, when it is confeſſed to be founded upon no reaſon at all, beſides that it is intolerable, that they that talk ſo much of liberty themſelves, ſhould not leave us at our liberty to act as our Oaths and as the Laws oblige us, when they can aſſign no reaſon why we ſhould not, and when the diſpute is about a matter in which they are not perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally concerned: if there be any reaſon why it is ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled it is onely becauſe it is a ſymbolical thing which hath been already anſwered, beſides that it ſtands per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly upon the ſame bottom with their own putting on clean cloaths and change of raiment on a Sunday, which that that day of the week is choſe above all the reſt to doe it in, it muſt be confeſſed to be done upon a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious account and a ſymbolical reaſon, out of reſpect to that day, and to intimate that purity and innocence of mind which is expected from them in the worſhip of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:172970:117"/> God. For the Communion Tables being railed in, and ſeparated in that manner which it is from the reſt of the Church, it is declared in the Canons of 1640. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle 7. that it is onely to avoid that irreverence and proſanation, which would otherwiſe bring a contempt upon all holy things, and upon the conſecrated Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themſelves.</p>
                  <p>It is rather neceſſary than otherwiſe that I ſhould be uncovered at Church, as being at that time more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the preſence of God, and that I ſhould kneel or ſtand rather than ſit at my Prayers, becauſe theſe are Natural poſtures of humility and reverence, and have been eſteemed ſo in all Ages and Nations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſitting, or leaning, or lying along do betoken a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative careleſneſs and diſregard of God and of his worſhip, and will without queſtion produce that bad effect upon the minds of men whereever they are put in practice; as on the contrary, a devout and ſubmiſſive geſture and deportment of our ſelves at the times and places of religious worſhip is of real benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to our ſelves, and is of good example to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and for the edification of all; which things are ſo plain and ſo undoubted a juſtification of all ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Ceremonies, that I need ſay no more concerning them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there is no Ceremony in our Church, which is or is pretended to be Idolatrous in its direction, for as to the bowing towards the Altar or Communion-Table placed at the Eaſt end of the Church, it is left to every man's liberty by the Canons of 1640. to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf in that matter as he pleaſes, ſo that here is nothing impoſed, and yet becauſe this hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo highly cenſured, and perhaps with ſome more tolerable pretence, than any of the other exceptions that are made, I ſhould not uſe it, ſince I am not enjoined,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:172970:118"/> where it may give offence or be an occaſion of ſcandal to the weak, but in Cathedral or Collegiate Churches, where the Congregations uſually are better informed, there is no reaſon why it may not be done, for it is not pretended that we bow to any carved Image, or to the likeneſs of any living Creature whether in Heaven or Earth, which was the thing expreſly forbidden by the ſecond Commandment, that we worſhip the Railes or the Table it ſelf, or at any time the conſecrated Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon it, which is likewiſe included in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Commandment, all which our Church does expreſly declare againſt, in as plain Language as words are capable of ſpeaking: And in the ſecond place it is to be conſidered, that the Iſraelites long before Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity was thought of, did always worſhip toward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that is, towards a certain quarter of the Heavens without any the leaſt ſuſpicion of Idolatry, and that for ought appears, onely by humane inſtitution; laſtly, I hope it will not be denied that God is in all times and places a very true and proper object of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and that there is no quarter of the Heavens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſymbolical reaſons upon which this practice depends, towards which we may not worſhip him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>As for our kneeling at the Sacrament our Church hath ſufficiently declared her ſelf in this point, that ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends no worſhip but to God onely, to God the Father, who ſent his onely begotten Son into the World to die for our ſins; to God the Son, who is then ſpiritually received, and dies afreſh for us in the merit, and virtue, and efficacy of his paſſion as often as we do worthily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of thoſe holy myſteries, and to God the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe Grace is then implored and received by us.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the Papiſts worſhip their Breaden God, ſhall it therefore be unlawfull for us to kneel at our Prayers,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:172970:118"/> to behave our ſelves humbly in the preſence of the true and onely God, to acknowledge our offences, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent us of our ſins, and give thanks to God for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to pray that the Body and Bloud of our Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> may preſerve our Body and Soul to everlaſting life, and to take that holy Sacrament to our unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eternal comfort, meekly kneeling upon our knees?</p>
                  <p>But it would be infinite to ſay all that might be ſaid upon ſo copious a ſubject, in which I have all the way ſo plainly concurring with me, the voice of reaſon, of experience, and of the wiſeſt and beſt men of theſe and all times ever ſince the Reformation, therefore I ſhall ſumm up all, as I began, with the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order.</hi>

                  <head>AN EXERCITATION Concerning the true Time of OUR SAVIOUR'S Laſt Supper WITH HIS DISCIPLES.</head>
                  <p>FOR the time of our Saviour's Paſſover, I affirm, that it was upon the evening of the fourteenth of <hi>Niſan,</hi> being the night before the <hi>Jews</hi> by the preſcription of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law were to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate theirs; and, for the proof of this, I ſhall produce theſe following places of Scripture in that order in which they are ſet down but not anſwered by the late excellent and profoundly learned <hi>Samuel Bochartus,</hi> who being dead, yet ſpeaketh, and whoſe Works will follow him through all generations laden with the ſpoils of indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; and the rewards of praiſe as long as civility and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhall endure; but it is excuſable in thoſe that write ſo much to be ſometimes miſtaken, and it is uſually ſeen that the errours of great men are like themſelves.</p>
                  <p>He therefore in his <hi>Hierozoicon,</hi> in that Chapter where he diſcourſes of the Paſchal-lamb, hath ranged thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which he pretends to anſwer in the following order.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Now before the Feaſt of the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, when Jeſus knew that his hour was come.</hi> And then,

                     <hi>v. 2. And ſupper being ended,</hi> &amp;c. From whence the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is clear, that if this place be to be underſtood of his laſt Supper with his Diſciples, then that laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was before the Feaſt of the Paſſover.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond place is the eighteenth Chapter of the ſame Goſpel at the 28. verſe, <hi>Then led they Jeſus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early, and they themſelves went not into the judgment hall, leſt they ſhould be defiled: but that they might eat the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over.</hi> Now this happening, as it did, the day after, or rather the very ſame day when our Saviour ate his Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over with his Diſciples, whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> were not to eat theirs till the night following; it is manifeſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Paſſover was a night before theirs.</p>
                  <p>The third place is Chap. 19. v. 14. <hi>And it was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Paſſover, and about the ſixth hour: and he</hi> (that is, <hi>Pilate) ſaith unto the Jews, Behold your King.</hi> Now if <hi>Chriſt</hi> were betray'd and carryed before <hi>Pilate</hi> upon the Preparation of the Paſſover, then the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paſſover was not yet come; for the <hi>Paraſceve</hi> or <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of any Feaſt was the day before it.</p>
                  <p>The fourth place is the 31. verſe of the ſame Chapter, <hi>The Jews therefore, becauſe it was the preparation, that the bodies ſhould not remain upon the croſs on the Sabbath day (for that Sabbath day was an high day) beſought Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</hi> In which words there are two things to be conſidered. Firſt, We have it again plainly aſſerted that <hi>it was the preparation of the Sabbath,</hi> which Sabbath this year was coincident with the Paſſover it ſelf.

                  <p>Beſides, it is worth our while to obſerve the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Phraſes by which the two latter Evangeliſts St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> have expreſſed themſelves; <hi>in which they killed the Paſſover,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> that is, when it was the uſual cuſtom of the <hi>Jews</hi> to kill their Paſſover, which was, as I have ſaid, upon the fourteenth of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> which anſwers to part of our months of <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>April;</hi> but Saint <hi>Luke</hi> is ſtill more expreſs, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>That which I take to be the very truth is this, That upon this day the Unleavened-cakes were made, and the Leaven purged out of all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> houſes, in order to the Feaſt, which is the preſent practice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> in his <hi>Synagoga Judaica;</hi> and to both of theſe it is that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alludes, <hi>1 Cor. c. 5. v. 7.</hi>

                  <p>Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> though with no better ſucceſs, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd that which ought onely to be deny'd, if any thing ought, and that is, that this Chapter of Saint <hi>John</hi> does any way concern our Saviour's laſt Supper with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: But if you conſider that this was that Supper from whence <hi>Judas</hi> went out to betray him; that this was that Supper in which he preached Charity and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Condeſcention to his Diſciples; which he is found to doe likewiſe in Saint <hi>Luke</hi>'s Goſpel; that the ſtory of that Supper which Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> refers to is manifeſtly contained in the twelfth Chapter of the ſame Goſpel, and that it is not likely we ſhould have two ſeveral relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſame Supper in two ſeveral Chapters immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately following one another. Laſtly, If you conſider that that expreſſion which immediately follows thoſe words, <hi>now before the feaſt of the Paſſover,</hi> viz. <hi>when Jeſus knew that his hour was come when he ſhould depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end,</hi> cannot ſo properly be applied to any Supper as to his laſt, you will then eaſily conclude with me, and with <hi>Grotius,</hi> who in this matter concurrs very ſtrongly in opinion with me, that it was indeed his laſt Supper, and that it could be no other.</p>
                  <p>To that Text of the ſame Evangeliſt, <hi>c. 18. v. 28. they themſelves went not into the judgment-hall leſt they ſhould be defiled, but that they might eat the Paſſover:</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, after ſeveral others, that by the Paſſover is meant the <hi>Chagigah,</hi> or Peace offerings, which were to be eaten together with the Unleavened-bread for all the ſeven
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:172970:134"/> daies of the Feaſt; but to this it is enough to anſwer, that this is by no means the moſt natural and eaſie ſenſe, and therefore when there are other places which in their moſt genuine and firſt acceptation do ſo unanimouſly conſpire to prove the ſame truth, That our Saviour kept his Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the night before the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved theirs, it ought by no means to be allow'd; but yet (though I am not obliged to put the cauſe upon this Iſſue, being ſupported by ſo many Authorities beſides that of this Text) if ſo much as one ſingle place can be produced beſides this which is in queſtion and muſt not therefore be alledged to juſtifie it ſelf, where the word <hi>Peſach,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But, ſecondly, it is agreed on all hands, If our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did not ſuffer upon the Paſſover it ſelf, yet that it was upon the firſt day of Unleavened-bread, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Sabbath, and kept among the <hi>Jews</hi> with all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and ſtrictneſs that can be conceived, it would have been no reaſon of their <hi>not entring into the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-hall,</hi>

                     </gap> was <hi>the day before the Paſſover,</hi> and not <hi>the very day of the Paſſover</hi> it ſelf: but, thirdly, if the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Calendar muſt be called in to determine this important Queſtion, which has exerciſed the wits of ſo many Learned men, we may remember that, in the ſixth of Saint <hi>Luke's</hi> Goſpel, there is mention made of the <hi>ſecond Sabbath after the firſt,</hi> which in the <hi>Greek</hi> is called, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>It is plain therefore that the Sabbath being a period or revolution of ſeven daies, the firſt Sabbath of <hi>Niſan</hi> muſt of neceſſity fall upon one of the daies incluſively of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and for the ſame reaſon the Paſſover, being a Feaſt of ſeven daies, it muſt alwaies have a Sabbath for one of the number, which being either the Paſſover it ſelf, or one of the daies of Unleavened-bread, it was for that reaſon of greater Solemnity, becauſe it was at once a commemoration of the Divine Reſt after the Creation of the World, and of his Goodneſs in their Deliverance out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and it had, beſides the daily morning or evening Sacrifice, the celebration of the Paſſover, or the <hi>Chagigah,</hi> into the bargain, and this Sabbath is that which is properly called, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or rather, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the ſecond Sabbath after the firſt of Niſan,</hi> which muſt of neceſſity fall either upon the Feaſt of the Paſſover it ſelf, ſuppoſing the firſt day of that month to fall upon the Sabbath, or elſe upon one of the daies of Unleavened-bread.</p>
                  <p>Now, if you conſider how many places of Scripture there are, which have been already produced, which do
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:172970:135"/> manifeſtly ſavour its falling upon the Sabbath that year when our Saviour ſuffered upon the Croſs; if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Solemnity the conjunction of the Sabbath would add to that of the Paſſover; if you reflect upon this, that no Execution could be done upon the Feaſt-day it ſelf, which was a Sabbath, in which it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to doe any Work, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 16. or for the Bodies of men to remain or be upon the Croſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 31. and that upon the firſt day of Unleavened-bread, in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they that lived at a diſtance from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were uſed to repair to their reſpective homes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 7. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it not being without great detriment to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs that many of them were forced to repair from the uttermoſt parts of <hi>Judaea</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> while God by a Miracle preſerved their Flocks and their Subſtance at home from the Incurſion of the neighbour Nations, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus,</hi> c. 34. v. 24. who, not being miraculouſly reſtrained, would have made uſe of this occaſion at once to enrich and revenge themſelves for the Injuries they had received, he was pleaſed, upon ſo neceſſary an occaſſion, to diſpenſe ſo far with the fabbatical Reſt, as to ſuffer every man to depart to his own home upon the firſt day of Unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened-bread, notwithſtanding it had in other reſpects all the ſolemnity and ſtrictneſs of a Sabbath; by which means it would have come to paſs, if our Saviour had been crucify'd upon that day, that he would not have been ſlain by all the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the Law required the Paſchal-lamb to be.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If you ſhall obſerve, what in this caſe is very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial to be conſidered, that if our Saviour had not ſuffered upon the uſual time, when the Paſſover was to be conſidered, that if our Saviour had not ſuffered upon the uſual time, when the Paſſover was to be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that is to ſay, upon the fourteenth of <hi>Niſan,</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fifteenth, or upon the firſt day of Unleavened-bread, he would not in this have repreſented the Paſſover, but the <hi>Chagigah,</hi> or Peace-offering, of the days of Unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened-bread,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:172970:136"/> neither would he ſo fully have anſwered the Legal Types, being no otherwiſe typify'd by the <hi>Chagigah</hi> than he was by all Sacrifices whatſoever, which though they did all of them point at that great Sacrifice, which was in <hi>the fulneſs of time</hi> to be offered up once for all, yet the Paſſover, and the Sin and Treſpaſs-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring had ſome ſort of preheminence above the reſt in this umbratical deſignation, as is manifeſt from his being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo frequently, <hi>the Lamb,</hi> and <hi>the Lamb of God,</hi> and the <hi>Lamb without blemiſh,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt our Paſſover;</hi> and from his ſuffering without the Gate, to anſwer the typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal adumbration of the Sin offering which was for this reaſon burnt without the Camp; certainly, from all this, you cannot chuſe but ſee it abſolutely neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that on the year of our Lord's Paſſion, the firſt day of Unleavened-bread and the Sabbath were co incident with one another, and that the <hi>Sabbatum Deuteroprotum</hi> was alwaies either upon the fifteenth of <hi>Niſan</hi> or elſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively from that to the one and twentieth.</p>
                  <p>What the true meaning of this <hi>Sabbatum Deuteroprô<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> or <hi>the ſecond Sabbath after the firſt,</hi> as we render it, ſhould be, has been a Myſtery which has been hid from Ages, and which it is now my happineſs, for the better adjuſting the true time of our Saviour's Paſſion, and for the farther vindication of the Scripture Hiſtory, which receives at once light and credit by being ſolidly explained, now firſt of all to diſcover.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eraſmus</hi> upon this occaſion gives a pleaſant Specimen of Monkiſh Ignorance, and Saint <hi>Jerom,</hi> (ſo long ago have Learned men been ignorant of the true meaning of this paſſage in Saint <hi>Luke)</hi> conſulting <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> upon this queſtion, was anſwered onely with a Jeſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of giving his opinion. <hi>De vocis</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Jews</hi> in this caſe did not count by Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, but by days; for though it be true what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, that from the morrow after the Sabbath, ſeven Sabbaths were to be compleat, yet when he ſpeaks of the way of counting theſe ſeven Sabbaths he ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Even unto the morrow after the ſeventh ſabbath, ſhall ye number fifty days;</hi> and ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> at this day keep their account, ſaying, the firſt after <hi>Omer,</hi> the ſecond after <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> &amp;c. till they come to fifty daies, as <hi>Grotius</hi> upon this place-hath-obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, which I believe has not yet been taken notice of by any other, though it be plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration againſt <hi>Joſeph Scaliger</hi>'s opinion, he proceeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a miſtaken notion of the word <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which in this Text hath two ſignifications, but neither of them ſuch as will ſerve his turn: for when it is ſaid, from <hi>the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row after the ſabbath,</hi> by the Sabbath is underſtood the firſt day of Unleavened-bread, which was, as hath been ſhewn, of a ſabbatical nature, let it fall upon what day of the week it would, and from hence they numbred ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:172970:137"/> Sabbaths, that is, not ſeven Saturdays or <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-daies, but ſeven times ſeven daies; ſo as, if <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>'s opinion be true, and if the Sabbaths were to be counted after his manner, then it would not be alwaies the Saturday or <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath on which the <hi>Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Deuteroprôtum</hi> would fall, but upon any day of the week indifferently; ſo, as for example, if the ſecond day of Unleavened-bread were upon the Munday, then the next Sabbath after it, excluding that day, that is, the next ſabbatical Period of ſeven daies would be upon the Tueſday come ſeven night, and this, according to <hi>Scaliger;</hi> would be the <hi>Sabbatum Deuteroprôtum,</hi> and the Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day come ſix Weeks after would be the day of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>That the Sabbath-day next before the Paſſover is at preſent called by the <hi>Jews, Shabath hagadol,</hi> that is, <hi>the great Sabbath;</hi> and that ſometimes the ſame Sabbath is called alſo <hi>Shabath hagadol,</hi> that is, <hi>the great Sabbath;</hi> and that ſometimes the ſame Sabbath is called alſo <hi>Shabath hariſhon, the firſt Sabbath.</hi> Now,

                  <p>This is as plain a repreſentation as can be given of <hi>Grotius</hi> his opinion; which after all is expoſed to more and greater inconveniencies than that of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> which both he and <hi>Capellus</hi> have rejected.</p>
                  <p>For, Firſt, granting him what he ſaies to be true, That the <hi>Jews</hi> at this day do call the Sabbath immediately go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Paſſover <hi>Shabath hariſhon</hi> or <hi>Shabath ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadol,</hi> the great or the firſt Sabbath; yet this is onely <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Secondly, His argument proceeding from the names now in uſe in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Calendars to thoſe which obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our Saviour's time, it is manifeſt that this way of argumentation is perfectly fallacious, becauſe if that ancient Calendar had not been loſt, there could have been
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:172970:139"/> no controverſie about the true meaning of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and if it be perfectly loſt, I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how any modern Calendar can help us out in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty which none but the ancient can determine.</p>
                  <p>But, Thirdly, if the Language of the modern <hi>Jews</hi> muſt be drawn into argument in this caſe, yet it ought to be drawn no farther than it will go; and ſince that has onely pointed out one great or firſt Sabbath in the year, it is unreaſonable upon that authority to eſtabliſh two other of which it is perfectly ſilent, and which, as ſilent as it is, it does very ſtrongly imply that there were no other Sabbaths that went by this name, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe this Sabbath would not have been called ſimply <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath hagadol</hi> or <hi>hariſhon,</hi> but <hi>Shabath hagadol hariſhon,</hi> the firſt great Sabbath, or <hi>Shabath hariſhon min hariſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim,</hi> the firſt of thoſe Sabbaths which are called Firſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is unanſwerable what <hi>Capellus</hi> objects againſt <hi>Grotius,</hi> that his notion of the <hi>Sabbatum</hi>

                  <p>Fifthly, and Laſtly, I ſhall prove immediately againſt <hi>Grotius,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> in their ancient Calendar had a day which they were uſed to call the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or <hi>firſt ſabbath,</hi> but that it was not the firſt before the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, but the firſt in <hi>Niſan,</hi> between which and the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over there muſt alwaies of neceſſity be one Sabbath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grotius</hi> being thus anſwered, <hi>Capellus,</hi> who has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken <hi>Grotius,</hi> comes next in courſe to be confuted himſelf; and though not having his Book at preſent by me, which it is many months ago ſince I read, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:172970:139"/> able to procure it, I cannot ſo particularly determine what his <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is, yet this, as I remember, is the foundation of it, that it depends upon the double account of the ſacred and civil year among the <hi>Jews,</hi> in reſpect of which <hi>Tiſri,</hi> which anſwers to part of our <hi>September,</hi> was the firſt month in one account, and <hi>Niſan</hi> in the other; now if it can be proved, with the good leave of the Chronologers, who are univerſally of another mind, that there was indeed no ſuch difference of account in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> year, then <hi>Capellus</hi> his conjecture, which is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon this difference, muſt of neceſſity fall to the ground.</p>
                  <p>There are but two waies that I know of by which this different account can be rendred either <hi>probable</hi> or <hi>certain;</hi> it might be thought <hi>probable</hi> if any uſe of ſuch a difference could be known, but ſuppoſing that one year conſiſted of as many days as the other, why may not one year ſerve all the purpoſes both of the ſacred and the civil account? and what then will a diſtinction of names ſignifie when the thing is the ſame?</p>
                  <p>It cannot <hi>certainly</hi> be proved, unleſs it be by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Scripture which is the onely authentick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in this caſe, and that is ſo far from favouring this conceit of a double account that it will perfectly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it. For all the light we have from Scripture is no more than this, that whereas the old year from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation began in <hi>Tiſri</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> yet in memory of the Deliverance of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the Bondage of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> at that time, they were from thenceforward ordered to change the beginning of their year, and to look upon <hi>Niſan</hi> or <hi>Abib</hi> as the firſt month in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Calendar; and therefore, though in the Hiſtory of the Floud <hi>Tiſri</hi> is expreſly called the firſt month, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the inſtitution of the Paſſover, whenever its order is mentioned, it is called the ſeventh, but no where the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:172970:140"/> firſt; neither was it ever after this accounted the firſt month in any reſpect whether ſacred or civil.</p>
                  <p>To make this out more clearly, you may obſerve, that all the ancient Chronology proceeded uſually by the Lunar year, and from thence it is that the <hi>Jews</hi> had no other name for a month but <hi>chodeſh,</hi> from a word that ſignifies to <hi>renew,</hi> which is a plain intimation that their months were meaſured by the return of their new moons; in which caſe one of theſe three things was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, either that their Feaſts which were either upon their new moons, or at ſuch a certain diſtance from them, ſhould run thorough all the ſeaſons of the year, or that in each month there ſhould be ſome daies added to make an equation with the Sun's motion; or, laſtly, that at the end of the year there ſhould be a Lunar month added to ſet the account even betwixt the Sun and Moon.</p>
                  <p>The firſt could not be, becauſe there were ſome Feaſts which could not be celebrated but at ſuch a ſeaſon of the year; as the Feaſt of Weeks or Firſt-fruits after all their Harveſt-work was over and their Corn inned into their Barns; and the Feaſt of Tabernacles, after the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their Autumnal Fruits, which two could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be kept at any other time than about Midſummer and Autumn.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond could not be, becauſe this would diſturb the obſervation of their new moons, by the intercalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one month's falling upon the new moon of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it remains therefore, that at the latter end of the year there was an intercalary month, by which the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation between the two great movers was preſerved.</p>
                  <p>Since therefore it is clear that all the <hi>Hebrew</hi> months were Lunar, they having no name for a month but what implies ſo much, one of theſe three things muſt needs be granted; either that thoſe things or actions which were
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:172970:140"/> uſed to recurre at certain ſeaſons with reſpect to the Sun, did yet notwithſtanding wander thorough all the Lunar months of the year, and did ſometimes fall out in this month, ſometimes in that, and every year about a month different from the other, ſo as in twelve years or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts to run thorough the whole courſe of Lunar months, or elſe there was a different way of intercalation in the civil year from the ſacred; or, laſtly, there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them, but the ſacred and the civil years are, as they ſay, a diſtinction without a difference, and words invented by Learned men to puzzle themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of informing the World.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe, ſince there was ſuch a connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt things civil or ſecular and ſacred as there was, and ſince they had ſuch a dependence upon one another, as the waving of the ſheaf, which was alwaies to be in <hi>Niſan,</hi> had a dependence upon the earing and ripening of the corn, and the Feaſt of Tabernacles or In-gathering upon the gathering of their autumnal Fruits, it cannot be queſtioned but both of theſe were meaſured by the ſame common meaſure; and to ſay otherwiſe is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly precarious, but alſo very unreaſonable, to think that people would perpetually trouble themſelves with two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts croſſing and diſturbing one another to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, beſides that it is precarious, and in a manner as troubleſome as the other, and that we have no names of months diſtinct from the Lunar, there can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any other intercalation, beſides that at the end of the year, be ſuppoſed, unleſs it be an Emboliſm at the end of every month; which would be to turn the Lunar into a Solar year without any ground, and contrary to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the word <hi>chodeſh,</hi> and to make every Solar month in proceſs of time to travell thorough all the names of the Lunar, ſince every ſuch month does gain ſome ground upon them.</p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:172970:141"/>
                  <p>It remains therefore that this diſtinction is frivolous and impertinent, and that there is no ſuch real difference as is pretended betwixt the ſacred and the civil year.</p>
                  <p>And now, to confirm what hath been ſaid, I will do theſe two things: Firſt, I will ſhow by another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument drawn from the notation of an <hi>Hebrew</hi> word, that the Lunary year was the onely year in uſe among the <hi>Jews.</hi> Secondly, I will anſwer ſuch places of Scripture as I imagine may be urged in defence of this double year.</p>
                  <p>And, Firſt, for the Argument drawn from the notati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is known very well that in <hi>Greek</hi> one of the names of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:172970:141"/> are equal to that larger circle which the Sun de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes.</p>
                  <p>The places of Scripture that come at preſent to my mind from whence this double account may ſeem to be juſtified are two; the firſt as long before the I aw as the Creation it ſelf: <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>And God ſaid, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night: and years.</hi> Which place, becauſe it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns the Sun and Moon, the two great Lights that were at that time created, it may ſeem that there was alwaies a different account of the Solar and Lunar year, as old as the Creation it ſelf; but to this, an expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of that Text is a ſufficient anſwer.</p>

                  <p>By their being <hi>for ſeaſons (lemohadim)</hi> two things may be meant, that is, either to point out the ſolemn and religious Feaſts, which all along in Antiquity belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the Moon, or to diſtinguiſh the ſeveral quarters and ſeaſons of the year, which is the natural buſineſs of the Sun, and is for that reaſon expreſly attributed to him in Scriputre.

                  <p>But theſe Lights were not onely for Signs and Seaſons, but alſo <hi>for days, and years;</hi> both of which, though they may indifferently be meaſured either by the Sun's moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or the Moon's, yet I conceive the earlieſt Antiquity as well in their account of days as months had a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reſpect to the motion of the latter, and that this was one reaſon, beſides what may be taken from the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Creation, why they began their natural day in the evening, from this Planet's having the dominion of the night; and as the month was made up as I may ſay of Lunar daies, ſo was the year of Lunar months, at leaſt in proceſs of time, when for avoiding of confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their Chronological account the motions of the Sun and Moon were adjuſted and fitted to one another, as it was by the intercalary month of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which they no queſtion borrowed from the neighbour Nations, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom the Moon had the Government of their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feaſts as well as among the <hi>Jews;</hi> otherwiſe, to ſpeak properly, every entire revolution of one of the Heavenly bodies is that which is called <hi>a year,</hi> at leaſt in the language of all the ancient World.

                  <p>Again, Since it was ſo that the <hi>ſabbatum deuteroprô<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> muſt of neceſſity fall upon one of the daies of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread, and ſince the Solemnity would be much greater if it fell on the <hi>firſt,</hi> which was the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>It being ſo undoubtedly clear that our Saviour's Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was celebrated the night before that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and it being unlawfull to ſacrifice the Paſchal-lamb at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time but on the fourteenth of <hi>Niſan</hi> between the two evenings, this has afforded new matter for the Wits of Learned men to exerciſe themſelves upon to find out an expedient whereby to make it appear lawfull to ſacrifice the Paſchal-lamb, which they ſuppoſe to have been eaten at this laſt Supper by our Saviour and his Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome that will needs have recourſe to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Talmudical</hi> Canons for the more orderly and regular obſervation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Feaſts; and the rule of the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they tell us was <hi>Badu,</hi> that is, that if the Paſſover happened to fall upon the ſecond, fourth or ſixth day of the week, it was transferred to the next day following, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the ſecond and ſixth, to hinder the concurrence of two Sabbaths together; this was the opinion of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> in his <hi>Annotations</hi> and in his <hi>Kalendarium Hebrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> and of <hi>Zegerus</hi> in his <hi>Notes</hi> upon the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and of <hi>Edvardus Liveloeus,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, once Fellow of <hi>Trinity</hi> College, and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Profeſſor of the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in a <hi>Chronological Diſputation</hi> upon this Subject againſt Cardinal <hi>Toletus;</hi> and, laſtly, of <hi>Iſaac Caſaubon</hi> who follows the other in his <hi>Exercitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> againſt <hi>Baronius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though it muſt be acknowledged that ſuch <hi>Talmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical</hi> Canons there were, yet it is equally true that they are of much later date than our Saviour's time, when they were uſed, (and for a long time after,) to celebrate the Paſſover indifferently upon any day of the week, though it ſhould ſo happen that the Sabbath ſhould be the day before it or the day after, as hath been proved by undeniable Teſtimonies from the <hi>Talmud</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:172970:147"/> Rabbins</hi> by <hi>Joannes Coch</hi> of <hi>Bremen</hi> in his <hi>Notes</hi> upon the <hi>Maſſecheth Sanhedrin,</hi> and after him by Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> in his Learned <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but moſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of all by <hi>Bochartus</hi> who has confirmed the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authority by the concurrence of Chriſtian Writers both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> and by the Practice of the <hi>Teſſareſcai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decatitae,</hi> who, in imitation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> were uſed to obſerve their <hi>Eaſter</hi> not onely upon the Sunday, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any day of the week on which the fourteenth day of the month ſhould happen to fall; nay, ſo little did they ſcruple the concurrence of two Sabbaths together by the Paſſovers being either the day before or the day after the Seventh-day-ſabbath, that in the <hi>Miſhna</hi> in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachim</hi> we have an expreſs proviſion in that caſe as to the time when the daily Evening-ſacrifice is to be killed, <hi>c. 5. Chal hereb peſach lehijoth behereb ſhabath,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>If the evening of the paſſover ſhall fall upon the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſabbath, then the daily evening-ſacrifice muſt be killed at half an hour paſt ſix,</hi> that is, with us; at half an hour paſt twelve, <hi>and it muſt be offered up at half an hour paſt ſeven,</hi> or, as we would ſay, at half an hour paſt one: and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his ſolution of the <hi>ſabbatum deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teroprotum,</hi> of which there hath been ſo much diſcourſe already, doth manifeſtly ſuppoſe the concurrence of two Sabbaths ſometimes among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſo doth S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Iſidore</hi> likewiſe; which ſolutions of theirs though they have been already conſidered and exploded, yet if no ſuch concurrence had been ever known, they had not onely been falſe in themſelves, but alſo built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a falſe foundation.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why theſe Learned men, who have ſtood up in defence of the <hi>Talmudical</hi> Canons, have made the difference between our Saviour's Supper and the <hi>Jews</hi> to ariſe from thence was this, that ſo it might appear that our Saviour did celebrate his Paſſover upon the legal
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:172970:147"/> day, whereas the <hi>Jews,</hi> being governed rather by the Traditions of their Maſters than by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to avoid the concurrence of two Sabbaths (the Paſſover that year, as they tell us, happening upon the Friday) transferred it to the next day, and ſo made a coincidence of the Paſſover and Sabbath together, but how indefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible this opinion is we have abundantly ſeen, and I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count my ſelf not a little happy, that, after the gleanings of ſo many Learned men, I have been able to confirm the truth by ſome new authorities not taken notice of by them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Expedient thought of by Learned men for the ſolution of this Difficulty is this, that both our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and the <hi>Jews</hi> celebrated their Paſſover upon the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal time, to the beſt of their underſtanding, on both ſides, but that they onely differed in their way of computation; our Saviour he went more exactly to work, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted his Paſſover from the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <hi>aſtronomical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> of the Sun and Moon, while the <hi>Jews,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſeems ſo good Aſtronomers, proceeded onely by the ſenſible <hi>phaſis,</hi> which was about a day after; but to this though it may be ſufficient to anſwer with <hi>Bochartus,</hi> that all this is <hi>gratis dictum &amp; fine ullo teſte vetuſtatis,</hi> that it is <hi>ſpoken without any the leaſt colour of authority to vouch it;</hi> yet it is farther true that <hi>Maimonides</hi> does expreſly affirm that it was a Tradition of <hi>Moſes</hi> from Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai</hi> that they ſhould compute their New-moons by the <hi>phaſis,</hi> and that as long as the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> laſted, and all the while the Doctours of the <hi>Miſhna</hi> and the <hi>Gemara</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved till the days of <hi>Abijah</hi> and <hi>Rabba,</hi> they had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of computation; and ſo it is alſo expreſly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that paſſage of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> of which I have already made ſo much uſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>that the Jews never celebrate any of their feaſts or ſolemn days but they compute them from the phaſis of the moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:172970:148"/>
                  <p>The third Expedient is that of <hi>Ludovicus Capellus,</hi> who pretends, as I remember, to ſolve the difficulty by the Emboliſm or Intercalation of a day at the end of the month foregoing, which being obſerved by the <hi>Jews,</hi> but not by our Saviour, makes the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paſſover a day later than his: but to this though we may anſwer as to the former, that it is perfectly precarious, it is onely faid and not proved; yet there is one place of Scripture yet behind, which will ſerve for a ſufficient Confutation of all theſe three Expedients, it is <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 29. when <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> went out to betray his Maſter, it is ſaid of his fellow Diſciples, that <hi>ſome of them thought, becauſe Judas had the bag, that Jeſus had ſaid unto him, Buy thoſe things that we have need of againſt the feaſt:</hi> which Feaſt, if it be meant of the Paſſover, as it can be meant of no other, then we have here an expreſs Teſtimony of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples themſelves, and certainly that is as good authority as can be produced, that the Paſſover was not yet come: For as for thoſe that expound it of the <hi>Chagigah,</hi> they do not conſider that upon the firſt day of Unleavened-bread, as this muſt be, if it were not the day before, it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull either to buy or ſell.</p>
                  <p>But, beſides theſe three, there has another way been thought of, as inſufficient in my opinion as any of the former; and that is, that as the <hi>Jews</hi> now a-days do uſe to keep the fifteenth and ſixteenth of <hi>Niſan</hi> both of them with a Paſchal ſolemnity, that they may be ſure to avoid a miſtake as to the time of the conjunction of the two Heavenly bodies, ſo from thence there are ſome that will needs infer that this was the ancient practice, and, at that rate, that night when our Saviour ſupped with his Diſciples was no leſs the Paſſover night than that which followed it. But firſt, it is to be conſidered, that there is no teſtimony of antiquity that can be produced to prove that this was the ancient practice, and therefore
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:172970:148"/> it is precarious. Secondly, The ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> if they did practiſe it, yet the practice of the modern can be no argument to prove it, becauſe what they doe is <hi>propter dubium conjunctionis luminarium,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> obſerves, whereas the Ancients went altogether by the <hi>Phaſis</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Maimonides</hi> obſerves that even in old time thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that were in captivity, or lived in foreign Countries, were uſed to obſerve two days together, becauſe they could not certainly tell what day the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> had conſecrated for the New-moon: But as this exception is an argument that it was not the general practice, ſo the reaſon given of it proves, that at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> this cuſtome never obtained; for there they could not be ignorant what day the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> had pitched upon. Fourthly, When the Friday on which our Saviour ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is called by Saint <hi>John,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the preparation of the Paſſover,</hi> it is certain it could not be the Paſſover it ſelf, for the preparation was onely in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it, and was of neceſſity a day before it. Fifthly, The place of St. <hi>John</hi> which I have produced upon the former head is every whit as good an argument upon this for had that day upon which <hi>Judas</hi> went out to betray his Lord been a Paſſover as well as that which followed next after it, certainly the Diſciples could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been ſo ſilly and ſo ignorant of their own cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Nation, and of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he was gone to buy any ſort of proviſion at a time when nothing could either be bought or ſold. Sixthly and laſtly it is an unanſwerable argument againſt this and all other ways of making our Saviour's Supper a properly Paſchal or Sacrificial Feaſt, that He himſelf was that <hi>Lamb of God</hi> whom all the <hi>moſaick</hi> Paſſovers repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and that he might unqueſtionably approve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſo, and unexceptionably fulfill the legal Types, it was neceſſary that he ſhould ſuffer at the true time
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:172970:149"/> when the Paſſover was to be killed, and therefore that true time could not poſſibly be come when he ſupped with his Diſciples: So that it being clear that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and his Diſciples: So that it being clear that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and his Diſciples neither did nor could partake of the Paſchal Lamb, properly ſo called, the queſtion is what manner of Paſſover it was which he celebrated with them, and I anſwer that it was that which <hi>Grotius</hi> calleth the <hi>mnemoneutical</hi> or commemorative Paſſover; and if you would know what manner of Paſſover that was, you may conſult <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> in his <hi>Talmudical Lexicon,</hi> under the word <hi>Aphicomen,</hi> and in his <hi>De Coenoe Dominicie ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus &amp; forma,</hi> and <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his <hi>De Coenoe Dominicie ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus &amp; forma,</hi> and <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his ſixth <hi>De emendatione temporum:</hi> I will not inſiſt upon it at preſent in this place, having done it already very largely in ſome other Papers.</p>

                  <p>IF the uſefulneſs of theſe Diſcourſes will not fpeak their Apology, notwithſtanding they are ſoe little of kin to any thing of a Sermon, which was the onely occaſion of their writing, then I ſhall be at a loſs for any other defence, and muſt ſubmit upon diſcretion to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of my Readers, who are my proper Judges, and from whoſe ſentence there lies no farther remedy or appeal.</p>
                  <p>I did not till very lately intend to publiſh the firſt of theſe Diſcourſes, but becauſe I find I have referred to it in the latter, (if it may be called the latter, for they are indeed all but one, and the reflexion upon this will doe a kindneſs to ſeveral paſſages which may otherwiſe ſeem abſurd) therefore I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded it to come abroad, leſt otherwiſe you might think me to be haunted with fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh
<pb facs="tcp:172970:152"/> Apparitions, and to refer to things that were not in <hi>rerum natura;</hi> or leſt you ſhould chance to looſe your way when you are ſo obligingly diſpoſed as to deſign me a Viſit, and for <hi>More-fields,</hi> inſtead of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> miſtaking one ſort of Hoſpital for another.</p>
                  <p>I have nothing farther to add, but that if you will pardon theſe digreſſions for this once, I will engage to you ſolemnly and <hi>verbo ſacerdotis,</hi> which was a very ſacred way of plighting Faith, before the diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh-Plot,</hi> to be more cloſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent for the future; and if what I have done already may have the good Fortune to meet with candid acceptance, it will give me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement as well to finiſh with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Vigour, what is now upon my hands, as to launch out farther into new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, for the improvement of Learning, and for the good of the World.</p>

                  <p>A ſecond reaſon from whence it may appear probable, that the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> were not permitted the uſe and reading of the <hi>ſacred Volumes</hi> in their <hi>private</hi> perſons or
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:172970:164"/> Families, is that a great part of it did not concern them, but was perfectly the buſineſs of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and of none but them; ſo that to inſtruct them in the knowledge of thoſe things, with that accuracy and niceneſs with which it was requiſite the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites themſelves</hi> ſhould underſtand them, was but to fill their heads with a ſuperfluous lumber, which was of no uſe to them, and was rather an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance than otherwiſe to their improvement in, and to their due attention to thoſe practical Precepts in which they were chiefly concerned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There were ſome things in the Law, the knowledge of which could ſerve to no other purpoſe but onely to be a perpetual temptation to tranſgreſs it, as men have uſually an hankering after thoſe things, which are with the greateſt rigour and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity forbidden them; ſuch was the confection or compoſition of the <hi>holy Oyntment,</hi> with which the Tabernacle and all its Veſſels and Furniture and the Prieſts themſelves were to be anointed, <hi>Exod</hi> 30. where after the enumeration of its ingredients from v. 22. to 32. it is added v. 32. 33. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon man's fleſh ſhall it not be poured, neither ſhall ye make any other like it, after the compoſition of it: it is holy and it ſhall be holy unto you, whoſoever compoundeth any like it, or whoſoever putteth any of it upon a ſtranger, ſhall even be cut off from his people.</hi> And the ſame is true likewiſe of the <hi>holy Perfume,</hi> whoſe ingredients are ſpecified v. 34. of which it is ſaid v. 37, 38. <hi>And as for the perfume which thou ſhalt make, ye ſhall not make to your ſelves according to the compoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: it ſhall be unto thee holy for the Lord, whoſoever ſhall make like unto that, to ſmell thereto, ſhall even
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:172970:165"/> be cut off from his people.</hi> Wherefore the knowledge of theſe two things in the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> being, if not put in practice, uſeleſs, and being practiſed, not onely dangerous, but fatal and deſtructive, it is moſt likely that as well the ingredients of theſe two <hi>holy Compoſitions,</hi> as alſo the proportions of each, and the manner of tempering and mingling them one with another, was kept as a ſecret among the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> or known onely to him or them who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were to whom the compoſition of them belonged.</p>
                  <p>What hath been ſaid of theſe two Inſtances, the ſame would be likewiſe true of what the <hi>Greeks</hi> call the <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> and the <hi>Jews, Haſhem,</hi> or <hi>Shem Hameporaſh, the name,</hi> or the <hi>nomen explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> the <hi>explained name,</hi> as it ſhould ſeem by an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſis,</hi> becauſe, if we will believe the generality of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Maſters, it cannot be explained, which being onely to be pronounced with its true Vowels by the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> once a year, when he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holy of Holies, was therefore probably, if this be true, (to hinder it from being profaned) kept from the knowledge of all but him, or his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Succeſſour in that high Employment; it is certain that at this day its true pronunciation is not known, and the <hi>Maſorethical Jews</hi> either out of <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> or both, are always uſed to point it either with the Vowels of <hi>Adonai</hi> or <hi>Elohim,</hi> but moſtly of the former; nay ſo fooliſhly ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious are they, that in the numbring of the Verſes in the preſent <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bibles, when they come to the <hi>15th</hi> verſe of any Chapter, whoſe proper marks

                  <p>A fourth reaſon then, which may be aſſigned, to make it appear that <hi>private</hi> perſons among the <hi>Jews</hi> were not permitted the reading of the Law, may be taken from their ſo frequent relapſing to <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> notwithſtanding the Law was ſo paſſionately ſevere in its denunciations againſt that dreadfull ſin, ſo frequent, ſo unwearied in its exhortations againſt it, and that the <hi>ſeven Nations,</hi> whoſe Land they came to poſſeſs, were rooted out from off the face of the earth for no other reaſon but this, or at leaſt for none ſo much at this, for their <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual fornication;</hi> it being impoſſible and abſurd to conceive, if all the people had been ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Law (which Law at the ſame time they muſt be ſuppoſed to acknowledge to have been of divine inſpiration, and that all the curſes and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings therein mentioned did and would certainly belong to the performance or violation of what that Law commanded); I ſay, it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and abſurd in this caſe to think, that <hi>Idolatry</hi>
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:172970:166"/> ſhould creep in ſo often as it did, without any noiſe or diſturbance; for in all thoſe revolutions in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, from the <hi>Eſtabliſhed Religion</hi> to the worſhip of <hi>Idols,</hi> and to the abominations of the <hi>Heathens</hi> round about them, though there might be and were actually ſome few who did not <hi>bow the knee</hi> to <hi>Baal,</hi> or ſubmit to thoſe pollutions which were ſo inconſiſtent with the worſhip and honour due to the true and onely God; yet it is manifeſt the Crowd and generality of the People were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſwept away with it, as by an <hi>Epidemical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,</hi> a certain <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Murrain</hi> of the mind.</p>
                  <p>And this fourth reaſon will borrow yet farther ſtrength from theſe three conſiderations, each of which are alone ſufficient, and much more all of them together to put the matter beyond all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of doubt or queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If we enquire into the true reaſon from whence it came to paſs, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church in the Adoration of <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Reliques,</hi> in the <hi>worſhip</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> and the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Maſs</hi> hath been guilty of ſo <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>execrable Idolatry,</hi> beſides an infinite number of the moſt <hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>ridiculous</hi> ſuperſtitions, that either the <hi>wit</hi> or the <hi>folly</hi> of man could invent; it is very plain, that the true and onely cauſe why the deluded World has ſubmitted it ſelf ſo tamely to be trampled upon and trodden under foot, in ſpite of common reaſon and common ſenſe, and hath believed the gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:172970:166"/> is ultimately reſolved into their unacquaintance with the Scriptures, which as long as they were in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe among the people, ſo long the Chriſtian Faith continued, as to the main, free from that foul degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy and corruption, to which it was afterwards for ſo many ages condemned, and under which ſo great a part of the Chriſtian World is to this day ſo fatally oppreſt; but when once the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Tongues became from vernacular to be learned languages, when neither the Fountains themſelves, nor their pureſt ſtreams could be repaired to by the ordinary people, and in too many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances not by the <hi>Prieſts</hi> themſelves, while Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were either not thought of or not permitted; this gave occaſion for ignorance and ſuperſtition, by inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degrees to corrupt and adulterate Religion; and for the craft and wickedneſs of deſigning <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who gain by nothing more than by the credulity and ſuperſtition of ignorant and fooliſh men, to introduce thoſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and practices into the world, which it is hard to ſay, whether they were better fitted to promote the outward pomp and ſplendour, the ſecular intereſt and advantage of the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> or more expreſſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>poſitive</hi> and <hi>declared Revelations</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> ſuch as are the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of <hi>the Maſs, Prayers</hi> and <hi>Maſſes for the dead, denying</hi> the <hi>Cup</hi> to the <hi>Laiety</hi> in the <hi>Holy Euchariſt,</hi> and the <hi>Celibate</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> or <hi>forbidding Clergy-men</hi> to <hi>Marry:</hi> of which the firſt and third were intended to create a reſpect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for the perſon of the <hi>Prieſt;</hi> the ſecond to be a perpetual <hi>Tax</hi> and <hi>Subſidy</hi> upon the <hi>Laiety;</hi> the laſt to ſecure the grandeur and external pomp of the <hi>Church,</hi> and all of them to fill the peoples heads with ſuch abſurd and groſly ſuperſtitious opinions, as are the moſt effectual means for the promoting and perpetuating to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, As unacquaintance with the Scriptures, which to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church are as a <hi>talent hid</hi> in a <hi>Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin,</hi> or a <hi>Candleſtick</hi> put under a <hi>buſhell,</hi> was the true cauſe of that Univerſal Idolatry and Corruption which prevails among the deluded Votaries of that Communion; ſo on the other ſide the true reaſon why the Reformed Churches have ſhaken off that yoke of abſurdities and abominations, why they have embraced a Religion more agreeable to nature, and more ſuitable to revelation, is to be referred to the <hi>Holy Evangeliſts</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every one of us, as they did to the multitude on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> in his <hi>own</hi> proper <hi>Idiom</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;</hi> which it is utterly impoſſible they ſhould do, but they muſt at the ſame time diſcover plainly to the world, God's utter deteſtation of all ſuch <hi>Idolatrous</hi> practices, and of all thoſe abſurd and unwarrantable opinions upon which thoſe forbidden practices are founded.</p>
                  <p>But, thirdly, to bring the matter a little more home to the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, if it be demanded why before the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they were ſo <hi>often</hi> guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but <hi>never</hi> after it, as it is plain they were not; the true reaſon of this is, that ſoon after the eſtabliſhed worſhip was again ſetled upon its old foundations by <hi>Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemias;</hi> the Tranſlation of the <hi>ſeventy</hi> was made out of the Original <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and from that time forward the Law was layed open both to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and the <hi>Gentile</hi> World.</p>
                  <p>And theſe three things, as I have ſaid, which are matters of fact, and arguments drawn from experience, I take to be a plain and undeniable demonſtration of the matter in queſtion, that the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> were not permitted the reading of the Law for themſelves, or in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective families or perſons.</p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:172970:169"/>
                  <p>This is the fourth reaſon, a fifth no leſs demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive than that is, ſhall be taken from the peoples calling to <hi>Eſdras,</hi> to <hi>bring out</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and of their having loſt not only the memory of thoſe <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>uſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> with which their ſolemn Feaſts were to be obſerved, but of the very <hi>Feaſts</hi> themſelves; of their having loſt their language in ſo great a meaſure, that <hi>Eſdras</hi> was forced not only to produce the Law, but to explain it to them, as I conceive, in the <hi>Chaldean</hi> or <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> tongue, which was then more familiar to them than their native <hi>Hebrew:</hi> All which it is utterly unconceivable how it ſhould ever have come to paſs, had it been the cuſtom of every private perſon to tranſcribe the Law for himſelf, as the <hi>Rabbins</hi> and their <hi>adherents</hi> would make us believe, and to reade it to his Children and Domeſtiques in his family; I ſay, it would have been impoſſible at this rate, that in ſo ſmall a period of time (there being ſeveral who had ſeen the firſt Temple, who likewiſe returned again from the Captivity and ſaw the foundations of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond lay'd) ſo <hi>ſtrange</hi> an ignorance, and ſo <hi>utter</hi> a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs of the whole Law ſhould over-ſpread the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Inſomuch that it was the opinion of <hi>Ireneus, Euſebius</hi> and ſeveral other of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in this Interval was utterly loſt, and that by a ſupernatural revelation it was renewed by <hi>Edras;</hi> nay, <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his book <hi>de habitu Mulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri,</hi> is ſo poſitive as to affirm it for a certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, <hi>Hieroſolymis Babiloniâ expugnatione dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, omne inſtrumentum Judaicae literaturae conſtat per Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dram eſſe reſtauratum;</hi>

                  <p>Neither need we be ſo ſcrupulous of rejecting the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in this caſe, if we conſider that the divine inſpiration of the ſeventy Interpreters, and their exact jumping together, notwithſtanding every man made his Tranſlation apart, is aſſerted by every whit as ſtrong, nay, a much ſtronger ſuffrage of antiquity than this of the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Now if it be true, as I have made it appear, that this was the cuſtom of all the ancient World, to keep their ſacred Volumes locked up in the Temples, and concealed from the knowledge of the common people; if this were the cuſtom of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> both of them ſo near neighbours to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> then theſe two things ſeem pretty plain.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If you add this general cuſtom to what hath been ſaid before to prove that the <hi>common Jews</hi> had little or no acquaintance with their law, I hope all this, taken together, will at leaſt ſtrengthen what former proof hath been given, if it may not pretend to be a new proof by it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If we ſhould ſuppoſe that the <hi>Jews</hi> had ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally that familiar knowledge of, and acquaintance with the law which is denied, what extreme madneſs and folly would it have been in this caſe for them to relapſe to the Idolatries and Superſtitions of the Heathen World, that is, to run out of the light of noon, into the darkneſs of midnight, to leave a Religion which they perfectly underſtood, and were not capable to be abuſed by the craft and ſubtilty of deſigning Prieſts, to embrace that, where all was kept ſecret, and where they were in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual danger of being impoſed upon by the deſigns and artifices of thoſe whoſe trade and livelihood depended wholly upon the credulity and ignorance of the people? or would they not rather have ſaid to any that ſhould have endeavoured to perſwade them to make ſo fooliſh and ſo unaccountable an exchange of their Religion, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Samaritane</hi> Woman, <hi>Tou know not what you worſhip, we know what we worſhip, for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of the Jews?</hi> So that beſides the direct proof of this aſſertion, which this conſideration will afford, here is alſo a <hi>Demonſtratio per abſurdum,</hi> and the manifeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of the contrary opinion is enough to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it.</p>

                  <p>Seventhly, For this reaſon the law is called the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of <hi>Levi,</hi> Malach. 2. 4. <hi>And ye ſhall know that I have ſent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Not but that the <hi>Covenant</hi> was made in <hi>common</hi> with the whole people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but it is called the <hi>Covenant with Levi,</hi> becauſe as it follows <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>The Prieſt's lips ſhould keep knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the law at his mouth, for he is the meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> And then <hi>v.</hi> 8. to ſhow how eaſie it was for them, who had the entire poſſeſſion of the law to themſelves, and who were the Oracles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom the people depended to impoſe upon them, and abuſe them at their pleaſure; it is added, <hi>But ye are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the way, ye have cauſed many to ſtumble at the law, ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly and laſtly, It is to be conſidered that in all the moſt ancient times of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, the ſacred Volume conſiſted wholly of Conſonants, and that the Vowels were ſupply'd, without the help of any viſible Characters, by the skill or <hi>traditionary</hi> uſage of the Prieſts, among whom it was preſerved; that it had no Vowels viſibly and determinately ſet down, is evident from the Genius of all the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> languages, to all of which this defect did anciently belong, and from the Writings of all the <hi>Rabbinical</hi> Doctors, whether Ancient or Modern, who always have, and ſtill do continue to this day, to write down only the Conſonants, or unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letters, leaving the Vowels to be ſupplied by the skill or conjecture of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ders; and, laſtly, from all the ancient MSS. of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible it ſelf; of which <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> who had ſeen Two thouſand, an incredible number, affirms, that he never ſaw any ancienter than Six hundred years, which had the <hi>Maſorethical</hi> Vowels and Accents annexed to it.</p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:172970:173"/>
                  <p>Now it being clear and evident, to thoſe who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any thing of theſe matters, from the nature of the thing it ſelf, and from the experience of thoſe differences which are to be found, by comparing the ſeveral Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have been made out of the Original <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> with one another, by collating the <hi>ſeventy,</hi> and the <hi>Chalday Paraphraſts,</hi> and the fragments of <hi>Symmachus, Aquila</hi> and <hi>Theodotion,</hi> the <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> and the ancient <hi>Medraſhes</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Expoſitions and Paraphraſes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (ſomewhat of which hath been already attempted by <hi>Capellus,</hi> but yet ſo as that, without any detraction from that incomparable work, there is ſtill an infinite field remaining for the induſtry of others to exerciſe it ſelf) I ſay, it being evident from all this, that the ſame Conſonants are capable of, and have been actually pointed with different Vowels, which different Vowels ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute different words by themſelves, and ſhall by the change of one or more ſuch words make a different ſenſe to ariſe in a ſentence taken together according to the ſeveral poſſibilities of variation in the ſame clauſe or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; it is manifeſt that every new way of pointing, is in effect a new Comment or Paraphraſe upon the Text, in which this variation is made.</p>

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:172970:173"/> the ſeveral Tranſlations with one another, to ſay nothing of that addition which might be made to theſe by a compariſon of all thoſe M SS. which are extant at this day, nor to take notice of the <hi>Keri</hi> and the <hi>Ketib</hi> of the <hi>Maſoreth</hi> it ſelf, or of the various readings of <hi>Ben Aſher</hi> and <hi>Ben Nephthali,</hi> that is, to ſay of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern Jews.</hi>

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:172970:174"/> of interpretation, ariſing from either of the two cauſes, which have been above ſpecified and aſſigned.</p>
                  <p>What confuſion would this have introduced into the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> part of the <hi>Moſaique</hi> Law, while every alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a letter or vowel would have made a new Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and there would have been as great diverſity of rites as there was poſſibility of variation, and all pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame divine authority to juſtifie and vouch themſelves? how would the people, out of that innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting humour which is natural to the populace of all the world, have divided and ſubdivided themſelves into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parties, Conventicles and Factions? and how would the Prieſts, as faſt as revenge, or ambition, or opiniatrity and affectation ſhould prompt them, have put themſelves in the head of diſagreeing Sects, and would have fomented thoſe differences among the <hi>Jews</hi> with the ſame real or pretended zeal and earneſtneſs that the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> do now among us, only with this advantage, that the <hi>Jews</hi> might have done it, when the interpretation of places, for want of a ſtanding punctation, was left ſo much to every man's honeſty and judgment, with infinitely greater plauſibility and pretence of warrant from above, than our diſſenting Incendiaries can do, who are ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lly driven out of all their poſts, unleſs it be their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, knavery and impudence, which are citadels im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable againſt all the power of argument in the world, and can only be taken in by the faithfull and vigorous exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of ſevere and wholeſome Laws? how would they have lampoon'd and ridicul'd the Prophets? and how would the ſeveral Parties, by a ſeveral way of reading, pointing or accentuation have diſcharged the ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies at one another? Laſtly, what ſtrange uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty would this have brought upon the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets?</hi> how would it have confounded all thoſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:172970:174"/> that foretold, and all thoſe Rites and Sacrifices that typified and ſhadowed out the coming of the <hi>Meſſias?</hi> And by conſequence how would it have perplexed and entangled, nay, plainly evacuated and diſanulled all the evidence which we have, beſides the unqueſtionable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> for the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion? how would it have baffled and defeated that argument for our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Perſon and Doctrine, upon which he himſelf laid ſo mighty ſtreſs, that he deſpaired any miracle, how great ſoever, ſhould perſwade them, with whom the teſtimonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> were of no force and ſignification? For upon ſuppoſition of ſuch infinite variation, as the Promiſcuous uſe of the Original <hi>Hebrew,</hi> before the uſe of points, would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, theſe teſtimonies could not poſſibly have been of any weight or value with any conſiderative or think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, becauſe the ſeveral readings by their mutual oppoſition would have deſtroyed and ſupplanted one another.</p>
                  <p>It is ſo far from being true, that the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> were permitted the promiſcuous uſe and reading of the Law, that it ſeems rather to have been denied to moſt of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> themſelves; for we are to conſider that in the diſtribution of the <hi>Levites</hi> to their ſeveral em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, there were none admitted to the actual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of any ſacred office whatſoever, till they were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the age of twenty years, and that at that age they were only capable of the more ſervile or handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work employments; and as they arrived to greater ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of years, ſo they were admitted to offices and employments of a more honourable nature; that there were ſome appointed for <hi>Porters,</hi> others for <hi>Singers,</hi> whoſe buſineſs was only to be inſtructed in the <hi>Songs</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> without any obligation that appears to any particular ſtudy of the whole Law: And ſo for thoſe that
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:172970:175"/> were employed, in dreſſing or preparing the ſacrifices, or in ſprinkling the blood, it was not requiſite they ſhould learn this skill by a perſonal converſe and acquaintance with the Law; as well becauſe all the Ceremonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the performance of ſuch Miniſteries as theſe, neither were nor could be preſcribed in the Law it ſelf, without ſwelling it into a much larger Volume, than that in which it is now contained, as hath been already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, to the ſhame of all Non-conforming ſcruples, and to the undeniable juſtification of humane inſtitutions in religious worſhip; as becauſe it is ſeen that things of this nature, that is, the ceremony and formality of Offices, whether Civil or Divine, may be and are actually handed down to men in a <hi>traditionary</hi> way; as it is poſſible for a man, and many a man actually does underſtand the Laws of <hi>England</hi> ſufficiently well, and yet in the practice of a particular Law-Court, is not half ſo well skilled as an ordinary Attorney.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all which, it is ſtill further to be conſidered, that at the return from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as hath been already obſerved, <hi>Eſdras</hi> did not only inſtruct the people in the knowledge of the Law, but alſo the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and the <hi>Levites</hi> themſelves, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 13. which would have been needleſs, if all the <hi>Prieſts</hi> had been equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the knowledge of it; or if ſome of them, unleſs in thoſe matters which belonged to their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar charges, which as well as the Law it ſelf, were now by ſeventy years diſuſe forgotten, had not been either altogether or very nigh as ignorant as the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore it is moſt reaſonable to conceive, that as the line and family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> were of all the <hi>Levitical</hi> race, the higheſt in the <hi>Prieſtly</hi> dignity among the <hi>Jews,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and the <hi>Levites</hi> are frequently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from one another in Scripture (though it is
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:172970:175"/> true that the <hi>Levites</hi> were <hi>Prieſts</hi> too, though in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter latitude, as well as <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>his ſons,</hi> being all of them equally ſubſtituted inſtead of the firſt born, and all of them dedicated, though in a leſs degree, to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and miniſtery of the holy things,) I ſay, it is highly reaſonable from hence to conclude, that the more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular knowledge and ſtudy of the Law was confined to the family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> who were thoſe <hi>Prieſts,</hi> moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and ſtrictly ſo called, whoſe <hi>lips</hi> in the language of <hi>Malachi</hi> were to <hi>preſerve knowledge;</hi> and to whoſe cuſtody alone, as being the moſt ſacred <hi>depoſitum</hi> in the world, the Original M S. of the Law it ſelf, or the moſt Authentique and unqueſtionable Copy of it, was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18.</p>
                  <p>It is not certainly for nothing that the Letter or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>Xerxes</hi> to <hi>Eſdras</hi> in <hi>Joſephus</hi> is thus ſuperſcribed, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>It being therefore thus clear from ſo many irrefragable arguments, that the reading of the law till after the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>ſeventy</hi> was not permitted the commonalty of the <hi>Jews,</hi> (which if it had, it would have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that both the law and language during this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, ſhould have been ſo utterly loſt.)</p>
                  <p>It being certain that they were kept in this ignorance and darkneſs, even in the time of their beſt Kings, of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah;</hi> and that it was ſo far
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:172970:176"/> from being diſallowed by God himſelf, that it ſeems ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly approved by him, in thoſe words of the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> which I have produced.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It being no leſs evident, that ſuch a conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law, from the knowledge of the common people, could not be without great inconveniences attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, by expoſing them to the cheats and impoſtures of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as it is at this day in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in a great meaſure, and by being in all probability the occaſion of their ſo frequently relapſing into the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worſhip of the Nations round about them.</p>
                  <p>From hence we have another pregnant inſtance how ſtrict and religious care was had to the preſervation of peace and unity in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church; and this example purſued into its conſequences, is ſtill a ſtronger argument for all thoſe humane means of unity and publique peace, which if quietly ſubmitted to and obeyed, will bring to paſs that bleſſed end they aim at, without expoſing us to any of thoſe dangers and inconveniences with which this <hi>Jewiſh</hi> prohibition was attended.</p>
                  <p>If it were lawfull or warrantable, among the ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> to prohibit the reading of the Scriptures, or ſo much as to permit them not to be read, becauſe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them would be attended with this fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that it would infallibly through the perverſneſs of bad, or the unskilfulneſs of ignorant men, have been the occaſion of great ſchiſms and diſorders in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and State, (as I have demonſtrated, it muſt needs have proved,) notwithſtanding the great danger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to which the prohibition it ſelf was expoſed; then certainly all thoſe humane inſtitutions which tend to the ſame end, without the ſame or any like inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience are undoubtedly lawfull and fit to be commanded, and conſequently both fit and neceſſary to be obey'd.</p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:172970:177"/>
                  <p>The great deſign of Religion is the peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mankind, and therefore whatever does in its own nature, or in its direct and neceſſary conſequence, tend to the diſquiet and diſturbance of the world, is naturally forbidden to men conſidered as members of a civil ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſuch was the promiſcuous uſe of the Law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets among the ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> and for that reaſon it was with equal juſtice and neceſſity forbidden; and if it be the ſame caſe in the permiſſion of things indifferent, or in the publique allowance of every man's private fancy and humour, as to the circumſtances and external Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of Divine worſhip; if this be always found by experience to be a means of crumbling men into Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Parties, of alienating mens affections, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniting their intereſts, and ſetting the ſeveral Parties at a perpetual ſtrife and variance with one another; then it follows plainly, that a prohibition of ſuch liberty under legal penalties, which is the only remedy againſt ſuch diſorders, is, becauſe neceſſary to a neceſſary end, the peace and welfare of Mankind, lawfull, and a duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on the Civil Magiſtrate, to whom the care of the publique peace and ſafety is committed; which if he ſhall neglect, he is anſwerable to God for the greateſt breach of truſt of which any publique adminiſtration is capable; and it being confeſſedly at every man's own choice, not conſidering him as a Member of a Society, what indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent poſture or circumſtance he will make uſe of in divine worſhip, otherwiſe there could be no indifferent things in nature; it is as neceſſary when he enters into, or engages himſelf in a ſociety, that he reſign up this liberty to the publique Will of the Supreme Civil Power, as any other privilege or power of acting, with which antecedently to all bargain or compact, he is by nature inveſted; For this plain reaſon, becauſe otherwiſe the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety can either not ſubſiſt at all, or not without perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:172970:177"/> trouble and diſorder; which becauſe it is in all its degrees, a proportionable tendency to an actual diſſolution, it may and muſt be reſtrained with the ſame care, with which Rebellion or Anarchy ſhould be avoided; which being the direct contrariety to Government, or the return of Society into a ſtate of nature, is that in whoſe preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by all neceſſary means the Magiſtrate is chiefly concerned.</p>
                  <p>We find in Scripture that even divine Laws themſelves are ſometimes of no force or obligation, when a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar act of Charity or Mercy either to man or beaſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; as when <hi>David</hi> and his followers <hi>ate</hi> the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, which could not legally be eaten by any but the <hi>Prieſts;</hi> and for the ſame reaſon the plucking a Sheep out of a pit, the pulling of ears of Corn, and healing of the blind on the Sabbath-day, are allowed not to be a violation of the Sabbath, though expreſly contrary to the words of that Commandment, wherein the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath, or a feriation from all manner of work or labour is enjoyned; which how ſtrictly it was obſerved, not only by the ſuperſtition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but by the appointment of God himſelf, in caſes where there was no ſuch abſolute neceſſity, we know by the puniſhment of him, who was ſtoned by the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation for gathering of ſticks on the Sabbath day.</p>
                  <p>If therefore a divine Law may be diſpenſed with in caſes of neceſſity, at the prudence and diſcretion of men, what can be more plain than that upon the ſame account a humane law may juſtly be enacted? For this reaſon, becauſe a diſpenſation of any divine Law, in caſes not particularly excepted in the Law it ſelf, is every whit as much an humane inſtitution, as any poſitive humane Law; and if there be the ſame reaſon of neceſſity in both caſes, that is, for the welfare of a particular perſon, and much more of a whole ſociety, they are both of them of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:172970:178"/> equal obligation; neither will it avail any thing in this caſe to diſtinguiſh betwixt humane inſtitutions in ſacred and in civil Matters, for certainly the obſervation of the Sabbath belongs to the former of theſe; and if humane laws may determine in what particular inſtances the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is violated, and in what it is not, that is, in what manner the Sabbath ſhall be obſerved; then it may as well determine, nay, and much more, any other bare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal circumſtance of Worſhip whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>But above all things, we can never too frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon what hath been ſaid as to the prohibition of reading the Law and Prophets to the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, which being a thing drawing ſo great inconvenience after it, and which could have no other good meaning than to preſerve the peace and unity of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, which I have ſhown plainly, without this prohibition could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been preſerved; this certainly extends in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence with much more concluſiveneſs to all thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients of publique peace and ſafety, whatever they be, which have no ſuch inconvenience attending; which to be ſure muſt be the caſe of all indifferent matters, which would otherwiſe ceaſe to be indifferent, and by being manifeſtly hurtfull would loſe their name.</p>
                  <p>But let not any man for all this think or ſuggeſt, that in this I favour the cauſe of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who deny the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace the uſe of <hi>Bibles</hi> in the vulgar tongue; for in the firſt place I only repreſent matter of fact, without making any application; in the ſecond I ſay there is great diſpari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reaſon betwixt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the <hi>Jews;</hi> for had the Vowels been added to the Conſonants in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſo as the ſenſe might have been more plain and leſs ſubject either to errour or deſign, which is the caſe of all our Bibles in the Modern Tongues, there had not then been the ſame reaſon to keep them lock't up among the <hi>Prieſts</hi> that there was; and it would have been as ſafe to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:172970:178"/> permit every man the uſe of the Law and <hi>Prophets</hi> for his own private reading, as it was after the <hi>ſeventy</hi> had compleated their Tranſlation, after which the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law was diffuſed in common among all the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, If the <hi>Law</hi> had contained only matters of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and rules of Life, which is the main buſineſs of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> it could not have been ſo lyable to any dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous corruption, becauſe it would be more difficult for any Doctrine to gain credit among men, which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted the common ſenſe and the common intereſt of Mankind; but in a book of Rituals and Formalities of external worſhip, as different readings muſt have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced different rites, ſo thoſe different rites would have produced ſo many different Parties and Factions among the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It was abſolutely neceſſary before the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of our Saviour in the world, that the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament ſhould be lay'd open to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge both of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> to prepare them for the reception of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was to come, and to render them the more inexcuſable, eſpecially the former, if at his appearance they did not give him that welcome and reſpectfull entertainment, which was due to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his character and perſon.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, We are expreſly commanded in ſeveral places of the N. T. to ſearch the Scriptures, we are told that all Scripture is written for our inſtruction, and <hi>Timothy</hi> is commended by St. <hi>Paul</hi> for his knowledge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from his youth upwards; and ſince all theſe places in the New Teſtament, where the Scripture or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are mentioned are to be underſtood of the Old, this is ſufficient to ſhow how neceſſary it was ſometime before our Saviour's appearance, and at that time it ſelf, and ever ſince, that the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament ſhould
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:172970:179"/> be lay'd open and expoſed to the view of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> did teſtifie of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and it would have been impoſſible to underſtand how all the Prophecies and Types of the Old Teſtament were fulfilled in the perſon, and by the ſacrifice of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> without comparing the Life and Hiſtory of that perſon, and thoſe types and prophecies together.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Since we are commanded in the Scriptures of the New Teſtament to ſtudy and ſearch into the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old; and that only for this reaſon, becauſe they bear their teſtimony to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whoſe types and ſhadows are explained and unfolded in the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> this is ſufficient to ſhow the obligation we are under, to ſearch the Scriptures of the New Teſtament alſo, becauſe they can neither be ſufficiently underſtood without one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the reading of the Old is enjoyned us only for that reaſon, that we may compare it with the New for our better underſtanding of both, and eſpecially the latter.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Since the Hiſtory of our Saviour's Birth and Life, and Miracles and Sufferings are ſo faithfully and particularly ſet down in the Goſpels, as this was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably intended for the benefit of all ſucceeding generations, who would otherwiſe have loſt that Hiſtory, or have received it, corrupted and imbezled by fooliſh and ridiculous Fables; ſo the greateſt benefit which any man can receive from a Narrative of this nature, is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the Original Narrative it ſelf, or from ſuch a faithfull tranſlation, as keeps the cloſeſt to the literal and Grammatical ſenſe of the Original; beſides, that ſuch Tranſlations, made by men of learning and integrity in all ages, into the vulgar tongue, for the uſe of the common people, are a perpetual ſecurity againſt all the corruptions and impoſtures of ſuperſtitious, ignorant or deſigning men.</p>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:172970:179"/>
                  <p>Eighthly, As there is matter of Hiſtory in the books of the New Teſtament, which is beſt preſerved and moſt edifyingly delivered to the common people, as nigh as may be in the very words, which, it may be ſuppoſed, the divine Pen-men themſelves, had they been to interpret their own books into Engliſh, or any other Modern lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage would have uſed; ſo there are alſo matters of Faith and Practice: The firſt of which as containing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries above humane comprehenſion, ought to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered as exactly as is poſſible in the very words of the inſpired Writers, to doe otherwiſe, being either to pretend to explain thoſe things which cannot be explained, or to make myſteries of our own, inſtead of delivering thoſe of God and Religion. And then as to the rules of life and practice, they can never appear in a more Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative or becoming garb, than in that which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath put them; neither can the native ſimplicity and beauty of the Goſpel, that peaceable and gentle temper which it breathes from it ſelf, and is apt to inſpire into all that converſe with it, be any way ſo advantageouſly and ſo profitably repreſented to the world, as by every man's peruſing the <hi>Goſpels</hi> and <hi>Epiſtles</hi> for himſelf, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>very Sermons</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of his <hi>immediate followers</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in thoſe very words, or their equivalents in which they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Though it cannot be deny'd when we have ſo many and ſo ſad experiences to convince us of the truth of it, that the reading of the Holy Scriptures in the vulgar tongue is attended with many inconveniences from the perverſneſs, the deſign, or the ignorance of men; yet thoſe inconveniences neither are nor can be ſo great, as that they ought to ſtand in any degree of competition with the ſalvation of the ſouls of men, which are of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more price and value than any other conſideration whatſoever.</p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:172970:180"/>
                  <p>Tenthly, Theſe inconveniences are not ſo great as thoſe to which not only particular perſons, but Religion it ſelf is expoſed by the contrary extreme, that is, by keeping the Bible lockt up in an unknown language, which is in it ſelf, and has been found by experience in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, to have been the cauſe of all thoſe monſtrous Idolatries and Superſtitions, all thoſe abſurd Fables and fooliſh Traditions, with which that communion is at this day polluted; and which inſtead of being ſo zealouſly practiſed, and ſo eagerly purſued after by the Votaries of that way, would by the light of Scripture, if they were to take their meaſures from thence, be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently detected and proportionably abhorred; which is not only manifeſt from the repugnancy of the Scripture it ſelf, to ſuch abominable trumperies and wicked impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the belief or practice of men, but alſo from the ſeparation of the reformed Churches from that of <hi>Rome,</hi> which proceeds altogether upon Scriptural meaſures, and cannot be juſtified upon any other pretence; and ſtill in all ages, ever ſince the corruption of Chriſtianity by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> artifices, from its firſt ſimplicity into a fardle of abſurdities and innovations, thoſe gainfull impieties have been proportionably detected, as there was more or leſs of Evangelical light and truth ſhining forth in the world.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, There never can any ſo great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence happen by a promiſcuous uſe of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the vulgar tongues, which may not in a great meaſure, if not altogether, be remedy'd by the ſtrict and impartial ſeverity of wholeſome Laws; and where Laws do not govern the outward practices of men, though they have nothing to doe with private opinions, while they remain ſuch and do not walk abroad; there the government muſt of neceſſity be diſſolved, and all the banks of order and ſociety muſt give place to a deluge of Enthuſiaſm and Fanatique madneſs.</p>
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:172970:180"/>
                  <p>Twelfthly, There can no miſchief or inconvenience follow upon a publique allowance of reading the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the vulgar tongues, if there be but ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints laid upon the practices and opinions of men, as are of abſolute neceſſity to the peace and ſecurity of every Commonwealth; and if thus much may not be allowed, if every man ſhall be permitted not onely to reade the Scriptures, but to interpret them as he pleaſes, and to practiſe in conſequence of his interpretation; ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious are the follies, ſo ſtrong the prejudices, ſo raſh and inconſiderate the zeal, ſo wicked and deteſtable the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of abundance of men; that if this be the true En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh of <hi>Goſpel-liberty;</hi> if this be that liberty which <hi>Chriſt</hi> came to purchaſe for us, and which he hath entailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every follower or diſciple of his, then his followers, though agreeing in this, That they all acknowledge him for their head and leader, will yet be at as great ſtrife and variance among themſelves; nay, and perhaps at greater too, than if they had been deſtitute of ſuch a common guide, who by ſuch an ungovernable, unbounded liberty of interpretation, ſpeaking no certain ſenſe, but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating himſelf in all things, to the follies, prejudices and deſigns of ignorant or wicked men, will inſtead of being the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> and the healer of all breaches and animoſities among us, prove the certain and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible cauſe of infinite miſery and diſtraction to the world.</p>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:172970:198"/> queſtion, but theſe being two places, both built by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and both ſo very like in ſound, that what little difference there is, may juſtly be ſuſpected to have come rather from the corruption of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> than from the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> themſelves; this, as well as the other, is no more than <hi>Adir mot,</hi> that is, <hi>arx lutea,</hi> which <hi>Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> will receive infinite advantage of probability above that of <hi>Bochartus,</hi> from theſe two Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That beſides what hath been ſaid of the Names of <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> and <hi>Annibal</hi> above, it appears, and may be proved that the very word <hi>Adir</hi> was a <hi>Phoenician</hi> word; ſo <hi>Priſcian</hi> in his <hi>5th</hi> Book makes <hi>Abaddir,</hi> that is, <hi>Pater magnificus,</hi> or <hi>validus</hi> or <hi>potens,</hi> to be the name of a <hi>God;</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his 44th <hi>Epiſtle</hi> does pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly refer it to the <hi>Gods</hi> of the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is no queſtion but both of thoſe places lying upon the Sea-Coaſt, and being intended by the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> in their Voyages for the convenience of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rining, and Tallowing, and taking in freſh water, and trading up the Countrey, there was always a conſtant Garriſon of <hi>Phoenicians</hi> in them both; and they were both of them places fortified as well as the skill of thoſe times would allow, and this the word <hi>Chatſar</hi> was very unfit to expreſs, it being expreſly apply'd to <hi>Country Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,</hi> and <hi>midland Cottages without walls,</hi> Levit. 25. 31. therefore all that is meant by <hi>Adrumetum,</hi> or <hi>Atramyttium,</hi> for they are <hi>both</hi> the ſame, is no more than a Garriſon or place of ſtrength fortified with a <hi>mud-wall;</hi> and ſo all theſe things do mutually ſtrengthen and confirm one another.</p>

                  <p>In which words, which it is needleſs to tranſlate at length, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> affirms, and ſufficiently proves by the inſtance of <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> who frequently mentions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies this Sacred Name, that it was not unknown to the <hi>Gentile</hi> world; and what he affirms of <hi>Jehvoh,</hi> which I have proved to be its moſt common, if not its only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, the ſame is likewiſe true of the name <hi>Eh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joh,</hi> which was as ſacred as the other, and may as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called the <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> that this alſo was known to the <hi>Heathens,</hi> it being that very name by which God declared himſelf to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and I think, though we had not Mr. <hi>Selden's</hi> Authority to vouch us, yet I have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved it from the Monuments of the <hi>Heathen</hi>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:172970:201"/> Antiquity, which have ſo exactly repreſented all theſe <hi>three</hi> names, which in their original and root are all the ſame, of <hi>Ehjoh,</hi> and <hi>Jehvoh,</hi> and <hi>Jah,</hi> that the matter here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after will not bear any longer diſpute among learned men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> tells us, that the <hi>ſeventy Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters</hi> do always interpret <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which are in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> both the ſame, and do exactly anſwer to one another. From whence there are two things obſervable: Firſt, That the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> who always point this name with the points of <hi>Adonai,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when <hi>Adonai</hi> it ſelf is joyned together with it, have manifeſtly borrowed this way of pointing from the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the 70; notwithſtanding they would fain make us believe that they are wiſer than they, and that they are not beholding to them in any kind whatſoever. Secondly, We ſee how ancient this ſuperſtitious reverence for the ſacred and incommunicable name has been, that the 70 have no where expreſſed it, by its proper Letters and Vowels, which is not only true of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> too, though the laſt of theſe be expreſſed by <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; yet ſo, as that the Name of God is hid in the compoſition, and cannot be diſcovered by one not skilled in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> language.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, He tells us that the <hi>Pythagorean Tetractys,</hi> which was ſo great a ſecret in that School, was no other than the <hi>Tetragrammaton</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that is, the name <hi>Jehvoh;</hi> for this is that name which is generally called the <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> though <hi>Ehjoh</hi> in its <hi>Hebrew</hi> form (though not as repreſented by the <hi>Greeks)</hi> have as much right to it as the other.</p>
                  <p>And in this conceit Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> tells us he differs from the <hi>interpretum turba,</hi> the <hi>common croud of Interpreters,</hi> though neither is he ſingular in this conjecture; and if he had gone along with the <hi>croud,</hi> he had been leſs miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:172970:201"/> For this is a very idle ſurmiſe of learned men to think that in this name there was any ſacredneſs in the number <hi>four,</hi> ſince <hi>Jah,</hi> which conſiſts but of two letters, was every whit as ſacred as the other, and as peculiar to God, as incommunicable to any beſides him, and as ſtudiouſly concealed from the knowledge of the <hi>Heathen</hi> World, by the 70 Interpreters, as the other two, which have all of them the ſame Fountain and Origination.</p>
                  <p>The ground of this miſtake does ſufficiently conſute it ſelf; for all the reaſon of this conjecture is founded only upon this, That the name of God was called by the <hi>Greeks Tetragrammaton,</hi> which ſeems by its <hi>ſound,</hi> and by the <hi>ſignification</hi> of its <hi>number</hi> to anſwer to the <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorean Tetractys;</hi> but they do not conſider, though the <hi>Rabbins</hi> after the <hi>Greeks</hi> have called the ſame name in its original, <hi>ſhemſhel Arbah Othijoth,</hi> as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved, yet the <hi>Greeks</hi> meant it only of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, of the Name of God, not as kept <hi>ſecret</hi> from the <hi>Heathen World,</hi> but as <hi>revealed</hi> to it, as hath already been made appear; ſo that at this rate <hi>Pythagoras</hi> would have had but little reaſon to boaſt of his <hi>Myſtery,</hi> which lay open to the view of all curious inquirers, as well of himſelf and his diſciples; for the time of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſenſis,</hi> falls above an hundred years lower than that of <hi>Numa,</hi> who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with <hi>Hezekias,</hi> being towards the latter end of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity, or about the return from it; whereas <hi>Sanchuniathon,</hi> who had his information from <hi>Gideon,</hi> and who was the firſt by whom this name was communicated to the <hi>Gentile World,</hi> belongs to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of the <hi>Judges,</hi> before that which was uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the oldeſt <hi>Epoche</hi> of time, <hi>The Trojan War,</hi> and within leſs than Two hundred years of <hi>Moſes himſelf, to whom this Holy Name was firſt imparted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:172970:202"/>
                  <p>Beſides, that though <hi>Sanchuniathon</hi> were perhaps the firſt who did in writing divulge this name to the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then World,</hi> yet is it plain from what hath been ſaid of its being communicated to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelf and his <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> in the time, and by the information of <hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that it was got abroad long before his time, and that it was no ſooner imparted to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves, than <hi>foreigners</hi> were made acquainted together with them; neither is it probable when <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> ſo frequently inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates this bleſſed Name, that he received his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, from the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Monuments of <hi>Sanchuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athon;</hi> but that it was then as publickly known, as it is now loſt and forgotten, by being ſtudiouſly concealed by the ſuperſtition of after-times, or by that common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, which the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity brought upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation and Language together.</p>
                  <p>But after all, it is nothing but want of skill in <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> which hath been the reaſon hitherto why learned men have favoured this opinion, That the <hi>Tetractys</hi> and the <hi>Tetragrammaton</hi> are the ſame. For what is <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractys?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is to be conſidered that the <hi>Pythagorick</hi> Philoſophy was uſed to explain all things after a <hi>myſtical</hi> manner by <hi>numbers</hi> and <hi>proportions,</hi> in which <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>unity,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is the moſt ſimple, undivided, and perfectly indiviſible root of all things; two, or what the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> call the <hi>Dyas,</hi> is the firſt principle of multiplicity or compoſition, and both of theſe added together, make the number <hi>three;</hi> in which, if you ſuppoſe each unite, to be <hi>one ſide</hi> of an <hi>oequilateral Triangle,</hi> and then by counting the ſides after the Triangle is built, you begin at any ſide indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>one, two, three,</hi> you come then back again to that ſide from whence you ſet out; which being conſidered in two different reſpects, as the <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> and the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:172970:202"/> 
                     <hi>terminus ad quem</hi> of this computation; the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle is therefore called the <hi>Tetractys,</hi> becauſe a Triangle returning into its head or fountain is the number <hi>four.</hi> And theſe numbers added to one another 1, 2, 3, 4. make the number <hi>ten,</hi> which is, as it were, the Univerſal Baſis of infinite numeration.</p>
                  <p>But that in this I may not ſeem to repreſent my own fond conceits, inſtead of the truth and reality of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorean Doctrine,</hi> I will here produce a place of <hi>Lucian</hi> out of his <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. It is a diſcourſe between <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who ſtood to be ſold for a Slave in the Market, and the perſon who came to cheapen and buy him; <hi>Pythagoras</hi> tells him he was able to teach him <hi>Muſick, Geometry</hi> and <hi>Arithmetick: Arithmetick,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I underſtand that already: Say you ſo,</hi> ſaid <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras; let me hear you number.</hi> At which he beginning to count, <hi>one, two, three, four: Do you ſee,</hi> ſaid <hi>Pythagoras, that which you call four, is indeed ten, a perfect or oequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral Triangle, and the Oath of me and my followers.

                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:172970:205"/> And he alſo produces the opinion of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> why <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was not performed till the <hi>eighth day, Quia antè eum diem infirmior infans quàm ut par ſit dolori; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe before the eighth day the child was uſually ſo weak, that this operation could not be performed without danger of life, or too great extremity of pain.</hi> But now that this reaſon of <hi>Maimonides</hi> is no reaſon at all, is plain from this, That the Circumciſion was never <hi>anticipated,</hi> though the child ſhould prove never ſo <hi>vigorous</hi> and <hi>ſtrong,</hi> as it is plain there is great difference in the ſtrength and vigour of children from the very birth, as well as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when they come to greater age; neither was it ever deferred any longer, though at the age of <hi>eight days</hi> the child ſhould prove never ſo <hi>weakly</hi> and <hi>unlikely</hi> to live. This therefore inſtead of being a ſolid reaſon, is but a <hi>Maimonidiſm</hi> or a <hi>Rabbinical dream.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame may alſo be ſaid of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s reaſon, why children had their Names given them upon the <hi>ſeventh</hi> day among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which term, if it were not by cuſtom either <hi>anticipated</hi> or <hi>prorogued</hi> according to the <hi>differing degrees</hi> of <hi>health,</hi> which is the general account why the <hi>ſeventh day</hi> above others was pitched upon; then this was either no reaſon at all, or which is ſtill worſe, ſo very bad a reaſon, as does ſufficiently betray and expoſe it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore more likely that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was miſtaken in his account, and that the <hi>true Original</hi> of this cuſtom was from the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were uſed upon the <hi>eighth day</hi> to perform the <hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> at which time alſo the Name was probably given to the child. And I think it may be pretty plain from all this, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Circumciſion</hi> upon the <hi>eighth day,</hi> and of not <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> up any <hi>animal</hi> in <hi>ſacrifice</hi> till then, was the ſame in both caſes, and had a <hi>myſtical alluſion</hi> to the <hi>ſeptenary

                  <p>As for <hi>P.

                  <p>From which Citation of <hi>Busbequius,</hi> in concurrence with the teſtimony of <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> there are ſeveral things very well worth obſervation: As firſt, that this was and is a <hi>general token</hi> of <hi>reſpect</hi> in the <hi>Eaſtern Countries.</hi>

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:172970:210"/> application or direction of the mind in the one and the other; and it having been ſhewn already out of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Records</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, that ſome ſuch ceremony as this was uſed in <hi>Divine Worſhip,</hi> of which every <hi>Oath</hi> is a part (it being an acknowledgment of the divine Omniſcience, and of his Juſtice and Power, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding an Appeal to the <hi>former</hi> as a witneſs, and a Prayer to the <hi>two latter,</hi> ſo to exerciſe and diſpoſe themſelves either for our benefit or hurt, as we aſſert truly, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form faithfully, what we affirm, deny or promiſe); it is manifeſt that this Modern cuſtom of the <hi>Eaſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> is the beſt explanation of that ancient uſage, of which we have given inſtances in the Story of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and that therefore <hi>R.

                  <p>Thirdly, By comparing this teſtimony of <hi>Busbequius,</hi> with the <hi>two places</hi> of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which we have mentioned, it appears how much <hi>Joſephus</hi> was miſtaken, who in his <hi>Antiquities, L. 1. c.</hi> 16. gives this account of that Story of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is to be found in the firſt of thoſe places, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:172970:211"/> theſe, they do but ſtill ſpeak him more plainly either an unwary or unlearned Writer; and indeed how is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to expect much of <hi>ſincerity</hi> from him, where he may either ſerve the intereſt of his Nation, or the credit of his own Eloquence and Parts, with which he muſt be acknowledged to have been very plentifully furniſhed, by putting falſe colours and artificial lights and ſhades upon his Story, when he gives ſo <hi>excellent,</hi> nay, ſo <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> a Character of our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf; for he queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whether he were a mortal man or no, and was in that reſpect under greater convictions than any of the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> of our days can be, and yet was not perſwaded to become one of his followers and diſciples; not that I would be ſo underſtood, as if I would utterly deſtroy the authority of his Writings; but I ſay there is care and judgment to be uſe in diſtinguiſhing his truth from his miſtakes, or his impoſtures.</p>
                  <p>And firſt in the <hi>general</hi> we may and ought to believe, that his main intention was to write truth, becauſe there was no reaſon why he ſhould doe otherwiſe, and becauſe to doe otherwiſe too palpably and too often would have expoſed him to the juſt indignation and hatred of his own Nation, and he would have been confuted and expoſed into the bargain. And laſtly, becauſe he that out of vanity, affectation or deſign would effectually deceive ſometimes, muſt be ſure for the moſt part to be a religious obſerver of truth, that ſo under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of his integrity, his falſhood may paſs with the leſs examination.</p>

                  <p>So then all this diverſity of reading, being ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ſo fairly reducible to the <hi>Zabratus</hi> of <hi>Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> the remaining queſtion is, who this <hi>Zabratus</hi> ſhould be, which is the thing I am now about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. <hi>Zabratus</hi> therefore is <hi>Jah Berith,</hi> the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> as the ſalt of the Sacrifice is called the ſalt of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> and God frequently calls himſelf in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>the God of Abraham, of Iſaac, and of Jacob;</hi> that is, he who had entered into Covenant with them and their poſterity, and circumciſion was the peculiar ſeal of that Covenant betwixt God and them; neither is it any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this caſe that <hi>Porphyrie</hi> calls this <hi>Zabratus,</hi> a <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian,</hi> becauſe the time of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> falls, as I have
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:172970:215"/> ſaid, towards the concluſion of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity, and ſo the names of a <hi>Jew</hi> and a <hi>Babylonian</hi> might well enough at that time be confounded together, becauſe of their being mingled and interſperſed among one another. <hi>Zabratus</hi> therefore, notwithſtanding he calls him a <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian,</hi> may be underſtood of the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and his converſe with him, may be meant of that part of his Philoſophy or Diſcipline which he learned out of the <hi>Moſaique</hi> Law, either by a peruſal of the Law it ſelf, which I ſcarce believe, for want of acquaintance with the language, which was then in a manner loſt among the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, or by converſe with the <hi>Jews;</hi> who though they had not now any accurate knowledge of the Law, yet were able to give him ſome <hi>traditionary</hi> and <hi>imperfect</hi> account: And this I the rather believe, becauſe all the three things which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> is ſaid to have received from <hi>Zabratus,</hi> are largely inſiſted upon in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Origine of all things,</hi> in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the <hi>diſtinction of foods</hi> or <hi>abſtinence from unclean things,</hi> in the Hiſtory of the Flood, and afterwards in the Body of the Law it ſelf; and, laſtly, <hi>the rites and ceremonies of luſtration,</hi> which are no where more nicely adjuſted than in the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law.</p>
                  <p>And if in theſe particulars he be not in every thing conformable to the platform of <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet this is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that he had no knowledge of that Law, or of the Religion and Manners of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but only that it was <hi>Traditionary, confuſed</hi> and <hi>obſcure;</hi> beſides that, there are two other cauſes which might and did probably conſpire to make a variation as to particular inſtances, though the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Pythagorean Philoſophy,</hi> were much the ſame with that of the <hi>Moſaique Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt out of a particular affectation to be the founder of a Sect, and to be thought, as well by himſelf, as others, to have been the inventor of a <hi>new Doctrine,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducer
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:172970:216"/> of a <hi>new</hi> Philoſophical inſtitution into the World.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He did not only converſe with the <hi>Jews,</hi> but with all other <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations, and ſo his Philoſophy was probably little more than a Medley of the <hi>Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phique</hi> and <hi>Symbolique</hi> Myſteries of divers nations (as all the Philoſophy and Religion of the Eaſt was wrapped up in <hi>Symbols)</hi> jumbled into a Philoſophical <hi>Oglio</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. It was much ſuch another thing in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>Sanchuniathon</hi> was for an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> of <hi>time,</hi> where there are many very plain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted ſtrictures of true and genuine antiquity: jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together without any regard either to truth or ſhame, (though I do not ſay the compoſition of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was equally frivolous and indiſcreet) with the <hi>Heathen My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology</hi> of all the barbarous Nations and fabulous times.</p>
                  <p>But after all, though the converſe of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> be at the ſame time an argument of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the <hi>Jews;</hi> yet it may well enough be, that that knowledge, which he is ſaid to have received from <hi>Zabratus,</hi> may be only a Tranſcript out of the ſacred Volumes in the Temple of an Idol, ſuch as that which by the <hi>Midianites</hi> and <hi>Amalekites</hi> in the book of <hi>Judges,</hi> was called <hi>Bahal Berith;</hi> for as <hi>Bahal,</hi> though it be for the moſt part applyed to the ſignification of an <hi>Idol,</hi> may yet notwithſtanding in its genuine and firſt acceptation denote and ſignifie the <hi>true God;</hi> ſo may <hi>Jah</hi> alſo, which is the <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>incommunicable</hi> name of the <hi>true God,</hi> who is only ſelf-exiſtent, and is what he is from himſelf, be apply'd not improperly, by the <hi>Heathens</hi> themſelves to the moſt contemptible and ſilly <hi>Idol</hi> in the world; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe let it be what it will in it ſelf, it is looked upon by them that worſhip it, under the notion of a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper Deity,</hi> and that it was actually apply'd to the <hi>Idols</hi>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:172970:216"/> of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> I ſhall immediately make appear; and and if I do, it will then, I hope, be granted, for another reaſon beſides what hath been already urged, that this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable</hi> name of God, which is every whit as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred as the <hi>Tetragrammaton</hi> (and conſequently that alſo), was not ſo great a ſecret among the neighbour Nations, as the <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> of the later <hi>Jews</hi> would make it.</p>
                  <p>So then <hi>Zabratus,</hi> though it may moſt properly and fitly be underſtood of the true God, yet nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but a falſe one may alſo be ſignified by it; and at that rate it will be the ſame with <hi>Baal Berith,</hi> whom <hi>Philo Byblius,</hi> the Tranſlator of <hi>Sanchuniathon</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, &amp;c. In which words, when I conſider what a ſtrange <hi>Miſcellany</hi> that Hiſtory of <hi>Sanchuniathon</hi> was, and as it ſeems a deſigned impoſition upon the credulity of after-ages; I cannot but believe, that this <hi>Abibalus,</hi> whoſe name does ſo exactly hit to the pat and proper ſignification of the true God, was one of thoſe names by which he was uſed to be called. For what is <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus,</hi> but <hi>El Abib,</hi> that is, <hi>Deus ſpicarum,</hi> as he was called from changing the beginning of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> year, to the month of <hi>Abib</hi> from <hi>Tiſri,</hi> of which ſo much hath been already ſpoken? And that which confirms me very much in this conjecture, is one of theſe four things which follow, and much more all of them together.</p>

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:172970:217"/> and learned times, I doubt it will be hard to find any inſtance of <hi>ſuch a dedication</hi> at a time, when <hi>letters</hi> themſelves were ſcarce known in the world, and without being able to produce an inſtance, it is very abſurd and ridiculous to ſuppoſe it; you may ſuppoſe any thing elſe, though never ſo extravagant, with equal reaſon. But if you will underſtand it ſo, as that the Monuments of <hi>Sanchuniathon</hi> were lay'd up in the Temple of <hi>Abibalus,</hi> which is the moſt proper ſenſe of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> in <hi>Greek,</hi> then, let the thing it ſelf be true or falſe, here is a kind of a confuſed and obſcure acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that <hi>Abibalus</hi> was the name of a <hi>God;</hi> which ſince he cannot be the ſame with the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We meet with other compoſitions exactly of the ſame form and analogy with this, in the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Antiquity; For as the God of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> for the reaſon above mentioned, was by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> or by the men of <hi>Berith</hi> called <hi>Abibalus,</hi> ſo by the <hi>Aegyptians Neptune</hi> was called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from <hi>El</hi> and <hi>Mos,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>water;</hi> exactly by the ſame Analogy with the other, as <hi>Tztzes</hi> hath recorded, which is a new argument againſt <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with <hi>Philo Judaeus,</hi> which is likewiſe backed by the teſtimony of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who ſaith, that among the <hi>Aegyptians Mos</hi> or <hi>Moy</hi> hath the ſignification of <hi>water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It matters not, though this name be no where found in Scripture, for the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> called even thoſe <hi>things</hi> and <hi>perſons,</hi> for whoſe knowledge they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:172970:217"/> either to the Scripture it ſelf, or to a Tradition derived from it, by names of a very different ſound, from thoſe by which they were called in the books of <hi>Moſes</hi> themſelves, though by their ſignification, as in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Abibalus,</hi> they did ſufficiently diſcover from whence they came. So <hi>Iſaac</hi> was called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, <hi>Jachid,</hi> as being the <hi>only ſon; Sarah, Annobret,</hi> that is, <hi>Quae per gratiam concepit,</hi> as having conceived and brought forth in her old age, when it had <hi>ceaſed to be with her after the manner of women;</hi> and the <hi>breath of God,</hi> which is ſaid to have been breathed into the <hi>noſtrils</hi> of the <hi>firſt man,</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, <hi>Kol phi Jah, Sonus,</hi> or <hi>Sibilus oris Dei.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, If we conſider the diſtance of the age of <hi>Sanchuniathon,</hi> from that of his Tranſlator <hi>Philo,</hi> who flouriſhed in <hi>Adrian</hi>'s time, it may ſeem very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the language out of which he made that Tranſlation was not ſo perfectly underſtood by him, but that he might be guilty of many and great miſtakes; ſo that if to the unskilfullneſs or wilfull errours of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, you add the defects and failures of the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there will but little of credit remain to that ancient Writer; only thus much is certain, that thoſe names which ſtill remain in their original ſound, are many of them owing, as to their ſignification, to the true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine antiquities of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as the manifeſt <hi>Anachro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſms</hi> which are to be found in thoſe <hi>Phoenician</hi> Fables, for they are no better, are a ſufficient confutation to themſelves; ſo on the other hand what there is remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreeable to that account of things, which hath been given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> is an undeniable atteſtation to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Writings, and ſhows plainly that there have been really ſuch perſons and ſuch tranſactions in the world, as have been left upon record by him.</p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:172970:218"/>
                  <p>But whatever becomes of <hi>Abibalus</hi> or <hi>Zabratus,</hi> in the latter of which eſpecially, I am not without great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that I am in the right; it is certain that in <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molxis,</hi> which was another name for one of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Maſters, who was, if I am not miſtaken, the very ſame with <hi>Zabratus,</hi> the name of <hi>Jah</hi> is very plainly contained, for this <hi>Zamolxis</hi> is evidently no other than <hi>Jah Moloc,</hi> or the King <hi>Jah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For in the firſt place, as for thoſe among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who will needs have <hi>Zamolxis</hi> to have been contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and to have been his ſervant, and to have received his Doctrine from him; this opinion is expreſly rejected by <hi>Herodotus</hi> in <hi>Melpomene,</hi> in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>I am of opinion that this Zamolxis lived many years before the time of Pythagoras.</hi> In the next place <hi>Mnaſeas</hi> in the <hi>Etymologiſt,</hi> who is tranſcribed by <hi>Suidas,</hi> ſaith, that he was worſhipped by the <hi>Getae</hi> for <hi>Saturn;</hi> nay, his words are more expreſs, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>that Saturn is worſhipped by the Scythians, and is called Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molxis;</hi> ſo then <hi>Zamolxis</hi> is evidently <hi>Jah Moloc,</hi> for <hi>Moloc</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> have always been accounted the ſame; and from hence it is that humane ſacrifices are offered to <hi>Zamolxis</hi> in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> as well as to <hi>Moloc</hi> by the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,</hi> or to <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Jupiter Latiaris</hi> by any other barbarous and heathen Nations; for he tells us, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly once in five year they were uſed to ſend a <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger</hi> to <hi>Zamolxis,</hi> with particular inſtructions to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him of what every one wanted, and to deſire him to ſupply their reſpective wants; and the manner of their ſending of him was this, that they were uſed to faſten three ſharp Stakes upon the ground, and then to take their <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> as they called him, and throw him upon the points of thoſe Stakes; in which caſe, if he dyed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:172970:218"/> they took it then for a good Omen, that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts were granted; but if he were not preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, then they were uſed to ſay he was a wicked man, and that <hi>Zamolxis</hi> would not receive his <hi>Meſſage,</hi> and ſo they ſent another and another in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, till ſome one was immediately diſpatched, and him they accounted acceptable and well-pleaſing to <hi>Zamolxis;</hi> which is a plain ſign that this <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> as <hi>Herodotus</hi> calls him, was looked upon as an <hi>Expiatory ſacrifice,</hi> which ought to be clean and pure it ſelf, that it may the better attone for the ſins of others. And that this <hi>Zamolxis</hi> is really a word of <hi>Hebrew Origination,</hi> appears ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from this, that as <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſays, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>ſome of the Scythians were uſed to call him Gebeleizin,</hi> which is no other than <hi>Gebel</hi> or <hi>Geboul,</hi> in compoſition with <hi>Zan</hi> or <hi>Zen,</hi> whom the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> would call <hi>Terminus,</hi> or <hi>Jupiter Terminalis,</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> himſelf afterwards renders it, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And ſo the particular tutelar <hi>Deity</hi> of the City of <hi>Emiſſa</hi> in <hi>Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> was called <hi>Alagabalus,</hi> that is, <hi>Eloah Geboul,</hi> the <hi>God of the Coaſt,</hi> or <hi>Preſident</hi> of that <hi>City,</hi> and the <hi>Territory</hi> belonging to it.</p>
                  <p>But beſides this there are ſeveral other things, which do very plainly confirm what I have conjectured, that <hi>Jah</hi> and <hi>Zamolxis</hi> are at leaſt ſo far the ſame, as that the firſt is a part of the compoſition of the latter.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is certain he was not worſhipped by any Image or ſenſible repreſentation, to which they always ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Spirit or Divinity of the <hi>Numen</hi> himſelf to be preſent; but they conceived of him, as of an inviſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, having his peculiar reſidence in heaven; for which reaſon the <hi>Jews</hi> were uſed to call God <hi>Shamajim,</hi> that is, <hi>Heaven;</hi> and that not only of latter times, but you

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Scythians</hi> believed of this <hi>Zamolxis,</hi> as the truth was, and as the <hi>Jews</hi> believed, and were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to believe of the God of their Fathers, that he was the <hi>Lord,</hi> and that there was <hi>none beſides him,</hi> none that might compare with him in Majeſty, Perfection or Power, Exod. 20. 3. <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me;</hi> therefore the <hi>Scythians</hi> were uſed to ſhoot up towards heaven, as it were in defiance, when ever it thundred or

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>This <hi>Zamolxis</hi> therefore was <hi>El heljon, Deus ille al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimus,</hi> as the <hi>Socinians</hi> are uſed to ſpeak in another caſe, in oppoſition to all inferiour and dependent Beings, and to all Images, or material repreſentations the works of nature or of art; and it is manifeſt from this, that theſe people were not <hi>Idolaters</hi> properly ſo called, but that they worſhipped the true God by his name <hi>Jah,</hi> though after ſuch a manner, as he had not only not appointed, but expreſly forbidden by commanding the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that they ſhould not ſuffer their children to paſs through the fire to <hi>Moloch,</hi> as the <hi>Ammonites</hi> were uſed to do, and by ſubſtituting the lives of <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Oxen</hi> to be an expiation for the ſins of <hi>men;</hi> by both of which there is nothing more plain, than that all humane ſacrifices were forbidden.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, They did not hold this of all departed ſouls, but only of thoſe that were good and vertuous, or at leaſt of ſuch as had lived within ſome tolerable compaſs of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and duty; both of theſe are expreſly aſſerted by <hi>Herodotus,</hi>

                  <p>Now both of theſe Doctrines, that is to ſay, of the Tranſmigration, and that it belonged only to good men, or at leaſt to ſuch as were comparatively and tolerably ſo.

Laſtly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 1, 2. <hi>As Jeſus paſſed by, he ſaw a man, which was blind from his birth, and diſciples asked him, ſaying, Maſter, who did ſin, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?</hi> Which place, though ſome learned men are pleaſed to interpret in favour of the Doctrine of <hi>Pre-exiſtence,</hi> in a ſuperiour ſtate, and a more refined, ſubtle and aetherial body; yet from thoſe teſtimonies of <hi>Joſephus</hi> and of <hi>Scripture</hi> it
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:172970:221"/> ſelf, which I have produced, think it much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to interpret it of the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſmigration</hi> out of one <hi>terreſtrial</hi> body into another.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the reaſons that perſwade me to believe the <hi>Zamolxis</hi> of the <hi>Getae</hi> to be a compoſition of <hi>Jah</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loc</hi> together, and conſequently are a confirmation of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> his either immediate, or at leaſt oblique and ſecondary acquaintance with the <hi>Jews;</hi> and I do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, that what I have ſaid upon this occaſion is ſo plain, and ſo demonſtrative, that it carries its own evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence along with it; and will therefore, as preſume to hope, give all the ſatisfaction, which an enquiry of this nature can afford to learned men. But notwithſtanding this, it is to be confeſſed, that <hi>Porphyrie</hi> gives another <hi>Etymon</hi> of this ſo celebrated and famous name, which I ſhall now produce to ſhow the unskillfulneſs of <hi>Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> and the inſufficiency of his conjecture; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of doing any diſadvantage or diſparagement to mine, ſhall but further recommend it to the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of every judicious and impartial Reader: the words of <hi>Porphyrie</hi> then are theſe, <gap reason="foreign">

That is, <hi>he</hi> (Pythagoras) <hi>had another boy, whom he bought in Thrace, whoſe name was Zamolxis, which name was given him; for that immediately after he was born, he was wrapped up in a Bears skin, for the skin of any beaſt is by the Thracians called Zalmos.</hi>
